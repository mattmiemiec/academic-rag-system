## RELEVANCE ANALYSIS


[Paper 1 - 2509.24294v1.pdf]
Relevance: Moderately Relevant
Explanation: Although this paper does not directly focus on machine learning for document classification, it discusses the importance of improving a distilled classifier's performance to construct high-quality and consistent graphs. This relates to the research question since machine learning techniques are essential in developing such classifiers.
Key Concepts: distilled classifier, graph construction, performance improvement

[Paper 2 - 2509.01514v1.pdf]
Relevance: Moderately Relevant
Explanation: This paper examines a method to minimize irrelevant contextual features in document classification while addressing the risk of over-filtering some query-document pairs. The study suggests adjusting thresholds or applying domain-based cross-encoders, which are relevant techniques for improving machine learning models used in document classification tasks.
Key Concepts: document-level relevance, filtering, contextual features, threshold adjustment, domain-based cross-encoder

[Paper 3 - 2509.14662v1.pdf]
Relevance: Highly Relevant
Explanation: This paper investigates the application of various machine learning models and techniques for document classification. The authors compare different pre-trained language models, fine-tuning methods, and embedding models to improve classification accuracy. These are central topics in the research question, making this paper directly relevant.
Key Concepts: machine learning models, pre-trained language models, fine-tuning, embedding models, classification accuracy
