We make hy- pothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hy- pothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini’s third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject. Keywords : string equation, harmonic and sub-harmonic series, combination-tone, psychoacoustics 1 Introduction One of the most intriguing concepts in music theory is the so-called sub-harmonic series , also referred to the undertone series or hypotonic series, which is defined in a way that mirrors the well-known harmonic series (also called overtones series). To fix ideas, we define a genuine sound as a periodic variation in air pressure. If τis its period, we denote byF= 1/τitsfundamental frequency . When the variation in air pressure is not strictly periodic, we speak more generally of a sound . The harmonic series is well understood from a mathematical, physical, and psychoacoustic perspective. A genuine sound of frequency Fcan be decomposed into sinusoidal components at frequencies that are integer1 multiples of F(see Figure 1), possibly with phase differences. This decomposition is well established physically (e.g., a piano string vibrates not only in its fundamental mode but also in higher modes), mathematically (Fourier series), and perceptually: the presence or absence of the various harmonic components determines the timbre of the original genuine sound. The n-th harmonic refers to the Fourier component at frequency nF. For instance, if the fundamental frequency of a genuine sound2corresponds to C 4(F= 262 Hz), the har- monic series will produce the notes C 5(the second harmonic of frequency 2F), G 5(the third harmonic of frequency 3F), C 6(the fourth harmonic of frequency 4F), E6(the fifth harmonic of frequency 5F), and so on—these are exactly the notes playable on a piccolo trumpet in C without engaging any valve.3 Since the birth of music theory, one of the most challenging problems has been to understand why certain combinations of genuine sounds are perceived as being consonant or dissonant, and whether this perception is shaped by cultural factors or by underlying physical phenomena. The presence of certain intervals (such as the 1Throughout this paper, the set of integers is understood not to include zero. 2In Scientific Pitch Notation (SPN), see [You39]. 3It is important to note",

In fact, such reconstruction also requires knowledge of the relative phases. Interestingly, the human auditory system is generally insensitive to these relative phases for genuine sounds (although they can be perceived for more complex sounds) [Moo12, ZF99]. 1arXiv:2509.26395v1 [eess.SP] 30 Sep 2025 Figure 1: Two periods of a sawtooth signal with a frequency of 262Hz with its first 3 Fourier components (left) and with their sum (right). . . .

This point of view was adopted by Zarlino (1517-1590) [Zar58], Descartes (1596-1650) [Des50], Rameau (1683-1764) [Ram22], Lagrange (1736- 1813) [Lag59, Lag62], Helmholtz (1821-1894) [Hel63], (see also [Pam89, Ste12, Cas15] for a historical perspective). One of the most relevant chords, whose consonance has been justified using this idea, is the major triad. Actually, in this triad all constituent notes are present in the harmonic series of the root. For example, the C major triad (C–E–G) is derived from the first five harmonics. In this sense, the major triad is perceived as con- sonant because the auditory cortex is accustomed to hearing it within every genuine sound that is sufficiently rich in harmonics. The question of consonance of the minor triad is more subtle. A possible explanation was already put forward by Zarlino in [Zar58]. He hypothesized the existence of the sub-harmonic series : the mirror image of the harmonic series, composed of sub-harmonics obtained by dividing the fundamental frequency by 2, 3, 4, etc. If we take again C 4(F= 262 Hz) as the reference, the sub-harmonic series includes the notes C 3(sub- harmonic 2 of frequency1 2F), F2(sub-harmonic 3 of frequency1 3F), C2(sub-harmonic 4 of frequency1 4F), A♭1 (sub-harmonic 5 of frequency1 5F), etc. (see Figure 2). The crucial point is that the first five sub-harmonics generate an inversion of a minor triad (in case of the C 4, an F minor chord: A ♭1–C2–F2).4is hard to perceive this triad due to the strong presence of lower frequency components C and E. This interpretation remained a matter of controversy for several centuries (see Rameau [Ram22], Haupt- mann [Hau53], Oettingen [vO66], Riemann [Rie93], Lewin [Lew82], Levy [Lev85]), including the question of whether subharmonics are actually perceived, and the search of sub-harmonics in brass and string instruments when they are played in a nonconventional way [Abb64, Abb65,",
    "a matter of controversy for several centuries (see Rameau [Ram22], Haupt- mann [Hau53], Oettingen [vO66], Riemann [Rie93], Lewin [Lew82], Levy [Lev85]), including the question of whether subharmonics are actually perceived, and the search of sub-harmonics in brass and string instruments when they are played in a nonconventional way [Abb64, Abb65, DP73]. See also [Pam89, Wie59, DP22]. Even though Zarlino and contemporaries hypothesize the existence of the sub-harmonic series, they could not know – due to limited physical knowledge at that time – that the sub-harmonic series is not physically present in the original genuine sound: mathematically, no Fourier components exist below the fundamental frequency. This, however, does not mean that Zarlino and contemporaries were focibly wrong, as the sub- harmonic series could be generated by the intricate structure of the inner ear or by the auditory cortex itself. The question of whether the perception of the sub-harmonic series is real or not remains an open question in psychoacoustics [Pam89]. It is worth noting that the sub-harmonic series is often associated with the perception of Tartini’s third tone (or combination tone), which refers to the perceived frequency |F1−F2|(or more in general |n1F1−n2F2|with n1andn2integer5) when two genuine sounds of frequencies F1andF2are played simultaneously. When F1 is very close to F2, Tartini’s third sound is simply a beat. Similarly to the sub-harmonic series, Tartini’s third 4To retrieve the root of the F minor triad, the sixth sub-harmonic must be added. Adding further sub-harmonics blurs the root again. Note that minor triad notes also appear in the overtone series, though much later and mixed with other harmonics unrelated to the minor chord. For instance, the 6th, 7th, and 9th harmonics of C 4correspond to a G minor chord (G 6–B♭6–D7). Beside the fact that the B ♭6is too flat (with respect to the natural or tempered scale), it 5|n1F1−n2F2|is actually the combination tone between the n1harmonic of F1and and the n2harmonic of F2. It is generated only if these harmonics are present in the original sound. 2 Figure 3: The sound (top) and its spectrogram (the ”sound image”, bottom) . tone is not physically present (see [Moo12, CMC18] and reference therin) and starting from Helmholtz [Hel63] it was long thought to originate in the inner ear due to nonlinear phenomena. More recent research suggests that such a tone may be as well generated in deeper brain regions, as it is still perceived when the two tones are delivered separately to each ear via headphones [BBWB20]. As already noted by Helmholtz, the explanation of phenomena such as Tartini’s third sound appears to require nonlinearities.6 In this paper, we show that both the sub-harmonic series and Tartini’s third tone can in fact be explained within a linear cochlear framework based on vibrating strings, provided that the transmitted information from the cochlea to the auditory cortex is taken to be the energy stored in the strings. The nonlinearity required to explain Tartini’s third tone is then inherent to the quadratic nature of the energy. We will return later to the relationship between Tartini’s third tone and the sub-harmonic series.",

The nonlinearity required to explain Tartini’s third tone is then inherent to the quadratic nature of the energy. We will return later to the relationship between Tartini’s third tone and the sub-harmonic series. The cochlea. The cochlea is a remarkable organ responsible for decomposing sound into its fundamental frequencies, thereby constructing the so-called spectrogram (see Figure 3). Roughly speaking, signals transmitted from the cochlea to the primary auditory cortex A1 via the auditory nerve encode the amplitudes of various Fourier components (but not their relative phases). Due to its simi- larity with the visual cortex V1, the auditory cortex A1 has led to the term sound image for the spectrogram, reinforcing the idea that we do not hear sounds per se, but rather we see their sound images (see for instance [Moo12, BPST21]). The cochlea is a rather complex structure filled with a fluid called endolymph that is set in motion by incoming sound via the outer and middle ear (pinna, tympanic membrane, and auditory ossicles). (See Figure 4.) These vibrations reach the basilar membrane , which can be modeled as a collection of tensioned strings of varying lengths linear mass and tension. We consider here the simple possible model in which the strings are noninteracting and are modeled by a simple linear damped string equation . Each string has its own resonance frequency (see below for the precise definition), and the oscillations are damped due to various mechanisms, the most immediate being immersion in a viscous fluid. Strings closer to the entrance point of the cochlea (the oval window ) have the highest resonance frequencies (around 20KHz), strings closer to the deepest point in the cochlea (the apex) have the lowest resonance frequencies (around 20Hz). When a genuine sound is perceived, the various strings of the basilar membrane are forced into oscillation. These oscillations are maximal when the resonance frequency of a string is close to the frequency of the input sound. The vibrations of different regions of the basilar membrane are detected by internal hair cells , which send signals roughly corresponding to the amplitude of the vibrations. Additional hair cells, known as external hair cells, serve to amplify vibrations but will not be discussed here.7 Let us parametrize the different strings by x∈[0, L]where 0is the base and Lthe apex. Roughly speaking, when the input is a genuine sound, internal hair cells transmit information on the amplitude of oscillations for 6It should be mentioned that there are several theories on the combination tone: Tartini’s theory [Tar54, Tar67], Lagrange’s theory [Lag59, Lag62] and – the most widely accepted – Helmholtz’s theory [Hel63]. See, for instance, [Moo12, CMC18, Abb65, Abb72] for an historical perspective. Here, we just mention that in contrast to Helmholtz’s theory which predicts |F1−F2|as main combination tone, Lagrange’s theory predicts, assuming F1/F2rational, the greatest common divisor between F1andF2. See Section 6.1 for the definition of the greatest common divisor between two numbers that are not integers. 7In this paper we consider",

Such information is encoded in a positive function E(x, t)of the string in position xat time t. One of the crucial hypotheses we make in this paper is to quantify this concept. We will assume that: (P)the signal sent to the auditory cortex by the cochlea is, for each string x, the energy E(x, t)stored in it. We now excite our model with a genuine sound and study the function E(x, t)in the long-time limit, after the transient dynamics have decayed. Details are given in Sections 2.2.3 and 4. The function E(x, t)has some important features: • Roughly, the function E(x, t)is almost constant in time and reaches its maximum at the value of xcor- responding to the string whose resonance frequency is close to the frequency of the incoming sound. This value corresponds to the main peak of the function. However, secondary peaks—though generally smaller—are also present. (See Figure 5.) Let us examine why. Peaks near to the harmonics. Assume that a genuine sound corresponding to C 4(F= 262 Hz) is per- ceived. If this sound is not a perfect sinusoid, it can be decomposed into several harmonic components. These physically present harmonics induce oscillatory peaks in those strings whose natural frequencies are2F,3F,4F, etc., enabling the perception of the timbre corresponding to the original genuine sound. Peaks near to the sub-harmonics. A vibrating string has different oscillation modes. If the fundamental mode corresponds to a frequency F0, the next modes correspond to frequencies 2 F0, 3F0etc. Hence, if a genuine sound corresponding to the C 4(F= 262 Hz) is perceived, this will activate the first mode of the strings whose frequency of resonance is close to Fbut also the second mode of the strings whose frequency of resonance is close to1 2F, the third mode of the strings whose frequency of resonance is close to1 3F, etc... Notice that all these strings will vibrate at the frequency of the forcing signal ( F= 262 Hz) but the information that is transmitted to the auditory cortex (being the energy stored in the strings only) is the presence of oscillations at the frequencies of1 2F,1 3Fetc. These frequencies correspond exactly to the frequency of the sub-harmonics and this idea explains their perception.8 As we shall see, in the simplest (more natural though) model, only the odd sub-harmonics appear. These are the most important ones since they contain the minor triad (the even sub-harmonics would produce 8The same reasoning also applies to all the harmonics of the incoming sound,",

The signal, which contains several harmonics (e.g., the sawtooth of Figure 1), excites the strings whose resonance frequencies are F(fundamental), 2F(second harmonic), 3F(third har- monic), and so on, as well asF 3(third sub-harmonic),F 5(fifth sub-harmonic), etc. As explained in Section 2.2, the sub-harmonicsF 2,F 4, etc. are absent (the caseF 2is shown with a dashed line). The upper panel is a quali- tative illustration of the energy stored in the strings. Further details are given in Sections 4 and 5, in which we show that residual temporal oscillations occur and that sub-harmonics of the harmonics are also activated. only lower octaves of the original sound). This fact is essentially due to certain symmetries of the model (see Section 2.2). Notice that, contrary to harmonics, sub-harmonics are present even if the original sound is a pure sine wave. In fact, in the case of a pure sinusoid, they become even more evident, as there are no higher harmonics to mask their perception. This is one reason why pure sine waves – or, for example, the sound of a clarinet, which lacks all even-numbered harmonics – are perceived as particularly “deep” or dark in timbre. •E(x, t)increases with oscillation amplitude but is quadratic rather than linear in the input, which – as we will see – gives rise to interference phenomena. This fact permits to explain Tartini’s third sound (which originates from nonlinearities) still working with a linear model. More precisely, as explained in Section 6, for a combination of two sinusoidal sounds of frequencies F1>F2, the nonlinearity of the energy stored in each string E(x, t)permits as well to see the appearence of residual oscillation in E(x, t)of frequencyF1−F 2 q, under the hypothesis thatF1+F2 F1−F 2=p/qwith pandq integer and p/qan irreducible fraction.9 For the most relevant combination tones, as for instance when F1=3 2F2, we have q= 1 and hence the oscillations of E(x)have frequency F1−F 2. Such oscillations in the energy of the strings are transmitted to the endolymph and returned back to the strings, producing the perception of the combination tone (notice, however, that such feedback is not described in our linear model). Our explanation of Tartini’s third sound is different from those ones by Helmholtz ([Hel63], which predicts F1−F2) and Lagrange ([Lag59, Lag62], which predicts the greatest common divisor of F1andF2). The three theories provide the same combination tone for the most relevant pairs of input frequencies. But the presence of the factor 9This is due to",

The three theories provide the same combination tone for the most relevant pairs of input frequencies. But the presence of the factor 9This is due to the fact that the energy is, roughly, a quadratic function of the incoming signal. Hence, if the incoming signal is sin(F12πt) + sin( F22πt), then the energy contains terms of the type (sin(F12πt) + sin( F22πt))2= sin2(F12πt) + sin2(F22πt) + 2 sin(F12πt) sin(F22πt). The last term can be written as 2 cos(( F1−F2)2πt)−2 cos(( F1+F2)2πt)and the greatest common divisor between F1+F2andF1−F2under the hypothesis thatF1+F2 F1−F2=p/q, with pandqcoprime, isF1−F2 q. 5 q, when different from 1, shed a new light on the understanding of this mysterious phenomenon.10 In conclusion, this paper shows that the emergence of subharmonics and Tartini’s third sound can be accounted for by a linear model of the basilar membrane, providing that two additional assumptions are made: i)the auditory cortex receives as input the energy stored in the various strings of the basilar membrane, and ii)not only the fundamental mode but also higher modes of oscillation must be taken into account. Thus, phenomena hypothesized as early as the 16th century are naturally predicted by a simple cochlear model. The description of the cochlea as a continuum of linear vibrating strings dates back to Helmholtz [Hel63] (see also [RH14] and references therein); these two aspects, however, have been largely overlooked. We should mention that a wide range of sophisticated models of the cochlea have been investigated, including nonlinear and active formulations (see, for instance, [Dui11, RR01, MH99, ES12] and references therein) as well as models focusing on traveling waves [B ´ek47, VW60, DJ03, Hul24]. In contrast to these approaches, our framework does not rely on the description of traveling waves, which are not particularly relevant for our purposes since we are mainly concerned with periodic input signals and their steady-state response. Moreover, while nonlinearities are essential to account for phenomena such as Tartini’s third sound, in our model these are incorporated directly into the quantity transmitted to the auditory cortex – namely, the energy – while the underlying mechanical system is represented by a family of linear vibrating strings. While preserving the necessary non-linear effects, this choice has the significant advantage of keeping the model explicitly computable, as the mapping from the input signal to the corresponding energy can be written in closed form. The paper is organized as follow. In Section 2 we introduce the model and describe its unforced oscillations, its response to a pure sinusoidal signal and its response to a genuine sound. In Section 3 we present our model for the signal sent to the auditory cortex, namely the energy stored in the different strings. In Section 4 we study the energy stored in the different strings under the action of a sinusoidal signal and we show the emergence of sub-harmonics. In Section 5 we study the energy stored in the different strings under the action of",
    "namely the energy stored in the different strings. In Section 4 we study the energy stored in the different strings under the action of a sinusoidal signal and we show the emergence of sub-harmonics. In Section 5 we study the energy stored in the different strings under the action of a genuine sound and show the presence of harmonics and sub-hamonics at the same time. In Section 6 we study the emergence of a combination tone when two sinusoidal signals of different frequencies are applied to the system. Throughout the study, whenever possible we used experimentally validated parameters for the numerical simulation. Unfortunately, it is very hard to obtain these parameters experimentally and their knowledge is fairly limited. We use two sets of parameters. The first set is extracted from [NVTM03] and a second set is modified by us, to obtain a more reasonable range of frequency covered by the model and to fit an assumption allowing to make certain computations more explicitly (see hypothesis (A03) in Section 2.1). These choices are explained in Section 7 and in Appendix A. The paper is, however, written in such a way that other values of the relevant parameters can be easily used. The emergence of the sub-harmonic series and of the combination tone appear to be independent from the choice of parameters, at least in a reasonable range. In Appendix B we give the proof of a crucial result concerning Tartini’s third sound. 2 A model of the basilar membrane as a set of noninteracting vibrating strings 2.1 The physics In the following we are going to model the basilar membrane as a set of non-interacting strings. The different strings are parameterized via their longitudinal position x∈[0, L], where 0denotes the base and Lthe apex. Each string has its own length ℓ(x), linear mass ρ(x), tension T(x)and damping γ(x). Letz∈[0, ℓ(x)]be the coordinate along one fixed string x. Let ux(t, z)the displacement of the string x at position zat time t. The external force acting on the strings, representing the sound, will be indicated by F(z, t). Its coupling with the different strings could in principle depend on xand will be indicated with c(x). Each string is going to be described by the following damped string equation ρ(x)ux tt=T(x)ux zz−γ(x)ux t+c(x)F(t, z), ux(t,0) = ux(t, ℓ(x)) = 0 . (1) 10The appearance of the combination tone is not restricted to the case in which F1andF2are rationally dependent. However, if this is not the case, the resulting sound is not a genuine sound (i.e., it is not described by a periodic function) and the problem should be treated differently. 6 For most of the results in this paper, it is not necessary to know the explicit expressions of ρ(x), T(x), γ(x), c(x). However, it will be useful sometimes to have models for these functions, mainly for numerical simulations. According to [RH14], we have that (more details are given in Section7 and Appendix A): •ℓ(x)is an increasing function of x. However, its variation is not very large.

According to [RH14], we have that (more details are given in Section7 and Appendix A): •ℓ(x)is an increasing function of x. However, its variation is not very large. Along the paper we will often consider that ℓis constant. • The linear mass of each string is varying as a function of xwith an exponential law ρ(x) =Aρekρx, with Aρ, kρ>0. Strings closer to the apex are much heavier. • The tension of each string is varying as a function of xwith a negative exponential law T(x) =ATe−kTx with AT, kT>0. Strings closer to the apex have less tension. • The damping of each string is varying as a function of xwith an exponential law γ(x) =Aγekγx, with Aγ>0andkγ∈R. See below for a discussion on the sign of kγ. • The function c(x)is a decreasing function of xmodeling the fact that the energy of the sound is already partially dissipated when the sound reaches the most internal part of the cochlea (large x). However, the decrease of c(x)is not very relevant and we will often consider the case c= 1. In the following, any time we use explicit expressions for ρ(x), T(x), γ(x), c(x), ℓ(x), we will refer to the following assumption (A0) We assume that ρ(x) =Aρekρx,T(x) =ATe−kTx,γ(x) =Aγekγx, with Aρ, AT, Aγ,kρ,kT>0,kγ∈R. We also assume that candℓare positive constants and we normalize c= 1. In the literature one also finds the following further assumptions in addition to (A0): (A01) kγ=kρ=kT. See for instance [Hul24] and references therein. (A02) kγ=kT+kρ 2(to have that γis proportional to the inverse of the undumped frequency of the string defined below in (2)). See for instance [Hul24] and references therein. (A03) kγ= 0(same damping for all the strings). This assumption, that we often make in the following, permits to simplify certain analyses. It is justified by the fact that sometimes in the literature one finds kγ>0 (meaning higher damping for lower frequencies, see for instance [Hul24, SCH15]) and somtines kγ<0 (meaning lower damping for lower frequencies, see for instance [NVTM03, NEAT14]). The case kγ= 0 has also be considered in [ZLP76]. Let us define the undamped fundamental angular frequency11of each string (see Section 2.2.2 for the justifica- tion of this formula) ξ(x) :=s T(x) ρ(x)π ℓ(x). (2) As in all realistic models, along the paper we will assume that ξis a decreasing function of x. This permits us to parametrize solutions of (1) by ξwhich is actually the only important parameter in the following. In particular, this is true under (A0), which implies ξ(x) = ↑ under (A0)q AT/Aρπ ℓe−kT+kρ 2x(3) Remark 1.

We consider initial conditions u(0,·)∈H1 0([0, ℓ])and ut(0,·)∈L2([0, ℓ]). In this setting, the existence and uniqueness of solutions u∈L∞(R, H2([0, ℓ])∩H1 0([0, ℓ]) is standard. See for instance [Hal88, Section 4.7]. Considering the basis en(z) =q 2 ℓsin(π ℓnz)forn= 1,2, . . .ofL2([0, ℓ])⊃H2([0, ℓ])∩H1 0([0, ℓ])we have u(t, z) =∞X n=1pn(t)en(z),where pn(t) =⟨en, u(t, z)⟩=Zℓ 0u(t, z)r 2 ℓsin(π ℓnz)dz.

Recall that the force F(t, z)is applied to the string through endolymph motion driven by the auditory ossicles. Neglecting boundary effects in the vestibular canal, the endolymph motion depends only on x. Thus, we assume: (A1) The applied force is independent of z, i.e., F(t, z) =F(t). As we will see this assumption will be responsible for the absence of even sub-harmonics.

    "we have α∈(0,2)andµ(ξ) =Bµξα,T(ξ) =BTξ2kT kρ+kT,νn(ξ) =Bνξα n(fornodd and zero otherwise). Remark 2. For the undamped case (i.e., ξ > µ (ξ)/2) to occur at high frequencies, it is natural to assume that α <1(see Section 2.2.2). Actually, this is always the case for the set of parameters given in Section 7 and Appendix A 2.2.2 Unforced case Let us discuss briefly the solution of the equation (11) in the case in which there is no forcing term ( F(t) = 0 ), i.e. ¨pn=−ξ2n2pn−µ(ξ) ˙pnn= 1,2,3, . . . (15) This can be alternatively written as a first order equation \u0012˙pn ˙qn\u0013 =Mn\u0012pn qn\u0013 where Mn=\u00120 nξ −nξ−µ(ξ)\u0013 , n= 1,2,3, . . . (16) • If there is no damping µ(ξ) = 0 , the solutions are oscillations of angular frequency nξ. This is why ξhas been called the undamped fundamental angular frequency of the string. In the presence of damping, since the eigenvalues of the matrix Mnare −µ(ξ) 2±ir n2ξ2−\u0010µ(ξ) 2\u00112 , (17) we have the following cases: • (underdamped case) ξ >µ(ξ) 2then for every nthe solutions are oscillations of angular frequency ωn=r n2ξ2−\u0010 µ(ξ) 2\u00112 and of exponentially decreasing amplitude. We call ωnthen-resonance angular fre- quency of the string. • (overdamped case) ξ <µ(ξ) 2then the above is true for nlarge enough only. For n≤µ(ξ) 2ξthe solutions go to zero without oscillating. 9 2.2.3 Asymptotic response to a sinusoidal signal In this section, we apply the simplest possible sound (i.e., a sinusoidal function) to our string equation 11, and we study the corresponding solution for large time, once the solution has become periodic. Studying this case permits to see the emergence of the sub-harmonic series. To this purpose, we start directly from the decomposition in Fourier modes under (A1) ¨pn= ↑ under (A1)−ξ2n2pn−µ(ξ) ˙pn+νn(ξ)F(t), n= 1,2,3. . . (18) with F(t) = sin( kt+φ) (19) Remarkably for every initial condition pn(t0) =a,˙pn(t0) =bthe solution of (18) converges exponentially to the periodic solution (see e.g., [Hal88]) pn(t) = ↑ F(t) = sin( kt+φ)−νn(ξ)\u0000\u0000 k2−ξ2n2\u0001 sin(kt+φ) +kµ(ξ) cos(kt+φ)\u0001 k4+k2(µ(ξ)2−2ξ2n2) +ξ4n4, n= 1,2,3. . . (20) In other words, this solution is globally attractive and periodic, and considering it amounts to ignoring the transient in the cochlear response. Notice that due to (10), we have that pn(t) = 0 forneven. We can write (20) in the form12 pn(t) = ↑ F(t) = sin( kt+φ)Rn(ξ,k) sin(kt+φ+ϕn(ξ,k)), n= 1,2,3. . . (21) where Rn(ξ,k) =νn(ξ)1p k4+k2(µ(ξ)2−2ξ2n2) +ξ4n4(22) ϕn(ξ,k) = arctankµ k2−n2ξ2(23) Remark 3. Under forcing, all strings oscillate with angular frequency k, even those ones for which we are in the over- damped case. Remark 4. The function Rnis always well defined for every (positive) value of n, ξ,kand every function ν(ξ),µ(ξ). If, in addition to F(t) = sin( kt+φ), we assume (A0), we have Rn(ξ,k) = ↑ under (A0)  Bνξ2kρ kρ+kT n1 √ k4+k2((Bµξα)2−2ξ2n2)+ξ4n4n= 1,3,5, . . . 0 n= 2,4,6, . . .(24) Study of Rn(ξ,k)fornodd • For fixed ξits maximum is at kmax n=q n2ξ2−µ(ξ)2 2.

However, we have the remarkable result that under (A03) its maximum is at ξmax n= ↑ under (A03)k/n. If we assume (A01) we have that the maximum is a bit displaced: ξmax n= ↑ under (A01)√ k4q B2µ+k2 n. 12Using the fact that sin(α) cos( kt) + cos( α) sin(kt) = sin( α+kt)⇒Asin(α) cos( kt) +Acos(α) sin(kt) =Asin(α+kt)and writing Acos(α) =k2−ξ2 nandAsin(α) =kµ. 10 Figure 6: The function R1for an input that is a sinusoidal signal corresponding to the C 4for the set of param- eters of Section 7.1 and of Section 7.2. Remark 5. Notice that each string has three different frequencies associated with it: •Its undamped resonance angular frequency ξ. •Its resonance angular frequency ω1=r ξ2−\u0010 µ(ξ) 2\u00112 . •The angular frequency of an external signal provoking the largest oscillations kmax 1=q ξ2−µ(ξ)2 2. In Figure 6, we depict R1(ξ,2π262) – i.e., we consider a sinusoidal input signal that corresponds to C 4– for the set of parameters of Section 7.1 (parameters of [NVTM03]) and of Section 7.2 (modified parameters and assumption A03). Notice the similar qualitative behavior. 2.2.4 Asymptotic response to a genuine sound Consider now a periodic signal F(t)with angular frequency k>0. Under the hypothesis given in Section 2.2 we have that that F|[0,2π k]∈L2[0,2π k]. Then F(t)can be decomposed in its Fourier components F(t) =∞X j=1cjsin(jkt+φj) (here for simplicity we are assuming that F(t)has zero average, so that jstarts from 1). By linearity, the corresponding response is pn(t) =∞X j=1cjRn(ξ, jk) sin(jkt+φj+ϕn(ξ, jk)), n= 1,2,3, . . . (25) where Rnandϕn, are given by (22) and (23). 3 A model for the information sent to the auditory cortex The observed insensitivity to the relative phases of the Fourier components (see, for instance, [Moo12, ZF99]) is a strong indication that the signal transmitted from the cochlea to the auditory system is not the full solution u(t, z)xof equation (1), but rather a smoothed version in which fast oscillations are averaged out. For instance, in the case of the response to a sinusoidal input as discussed in Section 2.2.3, what is sent from the cochlea is not the complete solution (here expressed through its Fourier coefficients) pn(t)forn= 1,2,3, . . ., but rather a quantity only related to the amplitude of the oscillations Rn(ξ,k). For a signal more complex than a pure sinusoid (e.g., the sum of two sinusoids with different frequencies), it is not immediately clear how to perform such averaging of the fast oscillations. In the following, we introduce a natural assumption that accounts for at least part of this averaging process, and that leads to the emergence of the sub-harmonic series in a very",
    "two sinusoids with different frequencies), it is not immediately clear how to perform such averaging of the fast oscillations. In the following, we introduce a natural assumption that accounts for at least part of this averaging process, and that leads to the emergence of the sub-harmonic series in a very natural way: (P)The signal transmitted from the cochlea to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in each string. 11 Referring to (1), such energy is E(x, t) =Zℓ(x) 0\u00101 2ρ(x)(ux t)2+1 2T(x)(ux z)2\u0011 dz (26) The first term is the kinetic energy due to the movement of the strings and the second term is the potential (elastic) energy. Decomposing in the Fourier basis used in Section 2.2.3 and writing xin function of ξ(with the usual abuse of notation) we obtain E(ξ, t) =∞X n=11 2ρ(ξ)\u0010 ˙pn(t)2+ξ2 npn(t)2\u0011 =∞X n=11 2ρ(ξ)ξ2n2\u0010 pn(t)2+1 ξ2n2˙pn(t)2\u0011 =1 2π2 ℓ(ξ)2T(ξ)∞X n=1n2\u0010 pn(t)2+1 ξ2n2˙pn(t)2\u0011 =∞X n=1En(ξ, t), where En(ξ, t) =1 2π2 ℓ(ξ)2T(ξ)n2\u0010 pn(t)2+1 ξ2n2˙pn(t)2\u0011 , (27) is the energy stored at time tin the Fourier mode nby the string whose undamped resonance angular fre- quency is ξ. 4 Perception of a sinusoidal signal and emergence of the sub-harmonic series In this section, we are in the same framework as Section 2.2.3, i.e., we assume F(t, z) = sin( kt+φ)and, in particular, we are working under (A1)). Using (21) we get that the signal transmitted by the cochlea to the auditory cortex is in this case E(ξ, t) =X n=1,2,3,......En(ξ, t)where (28) En(ξ, t) = ↑ F(t) = sin( kt+φ)1 2π2 ℓ(ξ)2T(ξ)n2Rn(ξ,k)2\u0010 sin2(kt+φ+ϕn(ξ,k)) +k2 ξ2n2cos2(kt+φ+ϕn(ξ,k))\u0011 =1 2π2 ℓ(ξ)2T(ξ)n2Rn(ξ,k)2\u0012 1 +\u0012k2 ξ2n2−1\u0013 cos2(kt+φ+ϕn(ξ,k))\u0013 . In the following, we call En(ξ, t)thenth sub-harmonic. Remark 6. Note that the series (28) is converging due to the term n4in formula (22). Moreover, for fixed n= 1,2, . . ., k, ξ > 0,En(ξ, t)is always positive. Remark 7. Note that only the odd sub-harmonics are present. In addition, for nodd, we have that En(ξ, t)is independent of time when ξ=k/n, i.e., when we are considering a string whose undamped resonance angular frequency (or one of its odd multiples) coincides with the angular frequency of the external signal. Around the same value ξ=k/nthe function Rn(ξ,k)has a maximum. For ξ̸=k/nthe function En(ξ, t)has residual oscillations with angular frequency 2k. This is due to the fact that frequency of cos2(kt)is twice the frequency of cos(kt). The same occurs for every odd sub-harmonics, hence the full series E(ξ, t)oscillates with angular frequency 2k. 12 Figure 7: The energy stored in the strings E(ξ, t)for an input that is a sinusoidal signal corresponding to the C 4(i.e., for k= 2π262sec−1,φ= 0) for the choice of parameters reported in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2. The higher peak corresponds to the frequency of the external signals. The lower peaks correspond to the sub- harmonics. Summing over n, the presence of these maxima produces several peaks, one for every sub-harmonic, as explained in more detail next. If we assume (A0) and use (14) and (24), we get E(ξ, t) =X n=1,3,5,...En(ξ, t)where En(ξ, t) = ↑ F(t) = sin(",

(29) In Figure 7, we depict the energy stored in the strings E(ξ, t)for an input that is a sinusoidal signal corre- sponding to the C 4. For better visibility of the sub-harmonic series, in Figure 8 we draw E(ξ, t)fort= 0(the variations in tare much smaller than the variations in ξ). To show that the variations in tare small, in Figure 9 we show E(ξ, t)for fixed ξ. Remark 8. Notice that for fixed ξ,E(ξ, t)is periodic with angular frequency 2k. In the same spirit as what is explained in Section 6, this oscillation is transmitted to the endolymph and then back to the forcing term. Although this phenomenon is not described by our linear model, it is going to produce an additional peak at 2k. This peak reinforces the perception of the second harmonic of the original sound. 5 Perception of a periodic signal When F(t)is a periodic signal, the corresponding energy E(ξ, t) =P∞ n=1En(ξ, t)is obtained by plugging (25) into (27). Notice, however, that E(ξ, t)is not a linear function of pn(t). As a result, the contributions of the different Fourier components of the original sound cannot be simply added; instead, they interact and give rise 13 Figure 8: E(ξ, t)fort= 0for the same parameters of Figure 7 Figure 9: For the same parameters of Figure 7, we depict here E(ξ, t)forξ= 2π250∼1570 (to be close to the main peak but not exactly on it) for t∈[0,2π/k]. Notice that such variations in tare periodic with an angular frequency 2kand that they are small. to interference phenomena. In other words, sub-harmonics can be summed, but harmonics cannot . More details concerning this nonlinearity are given in Section 6. In Figure 10 we draw E(ξ, t)for a sawtooth corresponding to the C 4for the parameters given in Section 7.1. Notice the emergence of harmonics and sub-harmonics. 6 More on the nonlinearity of the response: combination tone In this section, we study in more detail E(ξ, t)when the input signal is the sum of two sinus functions: F(t) =c1sin(k1t+φ1) +c0sin(k0t+φ2) (30) The main purpose here is to show the emergence of the combination tone when k1andk0are in a certain relation. It is also a starting point to study the response to a genuine sound with several Fourier components as in Section 2.2.4. Using the linearity of pnw.r.t. F(t)in (18), we have that (cf. (21)) pn(t) =c1Rn(ξ,k1) sin(k1t+φ1+ϕn(ξ,k1)) +c0Rn(ξ,k0) sin(k0t+φ2+ϕn(ξ,k0)). Then E(ξ, t) =P n=1,2,3,...En(ξ, t)where En(ξ, t)is given by Formula (27) that we report here by convenience En(ξ, t) =1 2π2 ℓ(ξ)2T(ξ)n2\u0010 pn(t)2+1 ξ2n2˙pn(t)2\u0011 .

Here, one sees the peaks corresponding to the harmonics of the original sound (the highest is the fundamental angular frequency of the sound). Second picture: E1(ξ, t) +E2(ξ, t).

Third picture: E1(ξ, t) +E2(ξ, t) +E3(ξ, t). Here, one sees the peaks corresponding to the harmonics of the original sound and of the second and third sub-harmonics. Notice the presence of sub-harmonics of the different harmonics. 15 Discussion When a signal of the form (30) is forcing our model (11), due to linearity, the strings whose undamped resonance frequency have a period close to (32) are not activated more than the other. However, the full energy stored in the system is oscillating with a period (32). One could consider a nonlinear model in which the oscillations of the total energy are transmitted to the endolymph and then back to the forcing term. Although this is out of the purpose of this paper, it would produce an additional peak around the angular frequency kcombination =k1−k0 q. Notice that in the psychoacoustic literature (see for instance [Moo12, CMC18]), the integer qis not present. Let us see what happens what happens with k1=3 2k0– an interval of a fifth – which are known to produce an easily perceivable combination tone.13In this casek1+k0 k1−k0= 5 hence q= 1 and the perceived angular frequency of the combination tone is the one found in the literature namely k1−k0. In table 12 the combination tones generated by natural intervals in between one octave are analyzed.14For the columns related to Helmohlz and Lagrange see Section 6.1. Notice that for most intervals q= 1. 6.1 Comparison with Helmholz’s and Lagrange’s theory Let us assume that k1=u wk0with u > w integers and coprime. We have that k1+k0 k1−k0=u+w u−w=:p q,with pandqcoprime. Recall that the angular frequencies of the combination tone given by Helmoltz’s theory, Lagrange’s theory and our theory, are (here GCD indicates the greatest common divisor): kH combination =k1−k0=u−w wk0, (33) kL combination =GCD (k0,k1) :=k0 wGCD (w, u) =1 wk0, (34) kcombination =k1−k0 q=u−w w1 qk0.

    "theory, Lagrange’s theory and our theory, are (here GCD indicates the greatest common divisor): kH combination =k1−k0=u−w wk0, (33) kL combination =GCD (k0,k1) :=k0 wGCD (w, u) =1 wk0, (34) kcombination =k1−k0 q=u−w w1 qk0. (35) Now, Let us set h=GCD (u+w, u−w), which implies that u+w=hpandu−w=hq. We distinguish two cases. Case 1. At least one between uandwis even. In this situation h= 1, hence q=u−wand kH combination =u−w wk0,kL combination =kcombination =1 wk0. (36) This holds true, for instance, when u−w= 1, in which case we have kH combination =kL combination =kcombination =1 wk0. (37) 13In the literature, see for instance [Moo12], the combination tone generated by the interval of fifth is considered particularly easy to perceive because k1−k0= 2k0−k1meaning that the combination tone generated by the two fundamentals is the same as the one generated by the fundamental of the higher sound and the first harmonic of the lower one. For this to happen, one needs sounds for which the first harmonic of the lower sound is present. See, for instance, [Moo12]. 14The intervals of the natural scale are constructed in the following way. Let us start from a given note k0(for instance corresponding to a C 4). The octave k1/k0= 2 is its first harmonic. The fifth k1/k0= 3/2is the third harmonic lowered by an octave. The major third k1/k0= 5/4is the fifth harmonic lowered by two octaves. The fourth k1/k0= 4/3is obtained as the difference between the octave and the fifth: 2/(3/2) = 4 /3. The minor third k1/k0= 6/5is obtained as the difference between the fifth and the major third (3/2)/(5/4) = 6 /5. The major sixth k1/k0= 5/3is obtained as the sum of the fourth and the major third: (4/3)×(5/4) = 5 /3. The minor sixth k1/k0= 8/5is obtained as the sum of the fourth and the minor third: (4/3)×(6/5) = 8 /5. The major seventh k1/k0= 15/8is obtained as the sum of the fifth and the major third: (3/2)×(5/4) = 15 /8. The minor seventh k1/k0= 9/5is obtained as the sum of the fifth and the minor third: (3/2)×(6/5) = 9 /5. The major tone k1/k0= 9/8is obtained as the difference between the fifth and the fourth (3/2)/(4/3) = 9 /8. The minor tone k1/k0= 10/9is obtained as the difference between the major sixth and the fifth: (5/3)/(3/2) = 10 /9(it can be also obtained as the difference between the major third and major tone 5/4/(9/8) = 10 /9). The diatonic semitone k1/k0= 16/15is obtained as the difference between the fourth and the major third: (4/3)/(5/4) = 16 /15(it can be also obtained as the difference between an octave and the major seventh: 2/(15/8) = 16 /15). The chromatic semitone k1/k0= 25/24is obtained as the difference between the major third and the minor third: (5/4)/(6/5) = 25 /24. The degrees of the major scale are: major second (major tone), major third, fourth, fifth, major sixth, and major seventh. The degrees of the minor scale are: major second (major tone), minor third, fourth, fifth, minor sixth, and minor seventh. 16 Figure 11: We consider here an",
    "= 25 /24. The degrees of the major scale are: major second (major tone), major third, fourth, fifth, major sixth, and major seventh. The degrees of the minor scale are: major second (major tone), minor third, fourth, fifth, minor sixth, and minor seventh. 16 Figure 11: We consider here an input signal F(t) = sin( k1t) + sin( k0t)with, as in Case 2 of Section 6.1, k1=7 3k0. Let us fix k0= 2π262sec−1. In this case E(ξ, t)has angular frequency2 3k0. For ξ= 2π250∼1570 , we plot E(ξ, t)in one period for the two choices of parameters used previously. Notice that the period of this function is neither the one predicted by Helmholtz4 3k0nor the one predicted by Lagrange1 3k0. As an example, we are in this case when k0andk1are two consecutive harmonics of the same root ¯k: k0=r¯k,k1= (r+ 1)¯k,with rinteger. In this situation k1=r+1 rk0, hence u−w= 1and1 wk0is the root ¯k. Case 2. Bothuandware odd. In this case h= 2. Then q=u−w 2and kH combination =u−w wk0,kL combination =1 wk0,kcombination =2 wk0. (38) These three numbers are all distinct unless u−w= 2. For instance taking u= 7 andw= 3 we have kH combination =4 3k0,kL combination =1 3k0,kcombination =2 3k0. This situation is described in Figure 11. 7 Choice of parameters for numerical simulations Under (A0), the model depends on several parameters: ℓ,L,Aρ, AT, Aγ, kρ, kT, kγ. Although we are mainly interested in a qualitative analysis we try to use values as close as possible to reality. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, these parameters are not known with great precision and they differ sensibly from one source to another. Our main references are [MLA24] and [NVTM03]. Let us start with Landℓ. • From [MLA24] we take L= 35 mm. Notice that in most literature (as for instance in [NVTM03]) Lis normalized to 1. We make this normalization in the following as well. Notice that with this choice kρ, kT, kγbecome adimensional. • Concerning ℓwe refer to [MLA24], where ℓ= 0.21mm at the base (x= 0) andℓ= 0.36mm. Since we are working under (A0), we are going to fix ℓ= 0.29mm= 2.9×10−4m independently of x. Concerning the other parameters, we first present (Section 7.1) a set of parameters deduced from [NVTM03] (see Appendix A for the precise comparison between our model and the model of NOBILI). We then slightly modify them to have a more reasonable range of frequencies [ξ(1)/(2π), ξ(0)/(2π)]and to fit (A03) (see Section 7.2). 17 Helmholzz }| {Lagrangez }| {our theoryz }| { Interval k1/k0 Note corres. tok1−k0 k0Note corres. toGCD (k0,k1) k0Note corres. tok1+k0 k1−k0=p qqk1−k0 qk0Note corres. to k1 k1−k0 GCD (k0,k1) to(k1−k0)/q octave 2 C5 1 C4 1 C4 3 1 1 C4 fifth 3/2 G4 1/2 C3 1/2 C3 5 1 1/2 C3 major third 5/4 E4 1/4 C2 1/4 C2 9 1 1/4 C2 fourth 4/3 F4 1/3 F2 1/3 F2 7 1 1/3 F2 minor third 6/5 E♭4 1/5 A♭1 1/5 A♭1 11 1 1/5 A♭1 major sixth 5/3 A4 2/3 F3 1/3 F2 4 1 2/3 F3 minor sixth 8/5",

Referring to Remark 1, with the values computed above we get ˜A= 2.2×105sec−1 ˜k= 5.7 The corresponding frequency range is [ξ(1)/(2π), ξ(0)/(2π)] = [120 ,35×103]Hz which a bit shifted toward high frequencies w.r.t. the classical range [20,20×103]. In the following, we propose modified values of Aρ, kρ, AT, kTwhich provide a reasonable range of audible frequencies. See Appendix A for the deatiles on how these modifications have been done. We also take kγ= 0 to fit hypothesis (A03). See Section 2.1. Notice that the presence of higher damping in this case, renders the pics less pronounced. They can be rendered more pronounced by lowering Aγwhich directly influences Bµthrough (12). Notice that the chosen value of Aγused here produces a bifurcation between the underdamped and the overdamped case (i.e. at ξ=µ(ξ)/2 =Bµξα/2) around 18Hz) which is close to the lower threshold of the audible frequencies. Finally the modified choice of parameters that we propose is the following Aρ= 6.9×10−3Kg/m2 kρ= 2.3 AT= 0.94Kg/sec2 kT= 11.5 Aγ= 8.3Kg/(m2sec) kγ= 0 From which we deduce that α= 0.33 Bµ= 24 sec(α−1) BT= 2.9×10−9Nmsec2kT kρ+kT Bν= 44×10−3m5 2 Kgsec2kρ kρ+kT (40) 19 With these values we get ˜A= 1.3×105sec−1 ˜k= 6.9 The corresponding frequency range is [ξ(1)/(2π), ξ(0)/(2π)] = [20 ,20×103]Hz. A Parameters used in numerical simulations A.1 The parameters of [NVTM03] The values of the parameters Aρ, AT, Aγandkρ, kT, kγare obtained from [NVTM03] by comparing their model with our model.

    "numerical simulations A.1 The parameters of [NVTM03] The values of the parameters Aρ, AT, Aγandkρ, kT, kγare obtained from [NVTM03] by comparing their model with our model. Before starting let us remark that in equation (7) ρis the density of mass by unit of area (unit of x-length and unit of z-length). As a consequence, the equation is written in units of mass/length2×acceleration namely in Kg/(m sec2)=N/m2. Consider our equation (7) ¨pn=T ρ\u0012 −π2 ℓ2n2\u0013 pn−γ ρ˙pn+c ρfn(t), n= 1,2,3, . . . . (41) Take the first mode n= 1and multiply it by ℓρ ℓρ¨p1=T\u0012 −π2 ℓ\u0013 p1−ℓγ˙p1+c ℓfn(t), (42) and compare it with equation (A1) of [NVTM03] m(x)¨ξ(x, t) =−k(x)ξ(x, t)−[h(x)−∂xs(x)∂x]˙ξ(x, t) +external force by unit of length (43) Notice that in equation (42) [ℓρ]=Kg/m which is the same as [m(x)]. Moreover, notice that in [NVTM03] L is normalized to 1, normalization that we make in (42) as well. Let us fix ℓ= 0.29mm= 2.9×10−4m. Comparing (42)and (43) we get ρ(x) =m(x)/ℓ, T (x) =ℓ π2k(x), γ(x) =h(x) ℓ Notice that in our model we do not have interaction among the different strings, hence in equation (A1) in [NVTM03], we are assuming s(x) = 0 . Now • In [NVTM03], Fig.2. m(x)varies between 0.1×10−5Kg/m (base) to 1.8×10−5Kg/m (apex). Hence ρ varies between 3.4×10−3Kg/m2to62×10−3Kg/m2. If we write ρ(x) =Aρekρx(with x= 0at the base andx= 1at the apex) we get Aρ= 3.4×10−3Kg/m2, k ρ= 2.9 • In [NVTM03], Fig.2. k(x)varies between 5×104Kg/(m sec2) (base) to 101Kg/(m sec2) (apex). Hence T varies between 1.5Kg/sec2(base) to 2.9×10−4Kg/sec2. Notice that Kg/sec2=N/m. If we write T(x) =ATe−kTx(with x= 0at the base and x= 1at the apex) we get AT= 1.5Kg/sec2, k T= 8.5 • In [NVTM03], Fig.2. h(x)varies between 2.4×10−3Kg/(m sec ) (base) to 0.5×10−3Kg/(m sec ) (apex). Hence γvaries between 8.3Kg/(m2sec) (base) to 1.7Kg/(m2sec) (apex). If we write γ(x) =Aγekγx(with x= 0at the base and x= 1at the apex) we get Aγ= 8.3Kg/(m2sec), k γ=−1.6. 20 As a consequence α:=2(kρ−kγ) kρ+kT= 0.78, Bµ= ↑ under (A0)Aγ Aρ r Aρ ATℓ π!2(kρ−kγ) kρ+kT = 0.16sec(α−1), BT= ↑ under (A0)AT r Aρ ATℓ π!2kT kρ+kT = 1.5×10−8Nmsec2kT kρ+kT, Bν=1 Aρ r Aρ ATℓ π!2kρ kρ+kT2√ 2 π√ ℓ= 8.7×10−3m5 2 Kgsec2kρ kρ+kT. Remark 9. Notice that •[Bµ]are obtained considering that from (17) [µ] = [ξ] =1/sec. Hence from µ=Bµξαwe get [Bµ] =sec(α−1). •[BT]are obtained considering that T(ξ) =BTξ2kT kρ+kTand that [T] =N/m and [ξ] =1/sec which implies that [BT] =Nm(sec)2kT kρ+kT •[Bν]are obtained considering that ν(x) =c(x) ρ(x)2√ 2 πp ℓ(x).

This could be due to the fact that it is not easy to extract precise values of the parameters from Fig.2 of [NVTM03]. The range of frequencies covered by the model is adjusted by considering that •m(x)varies between 0.2×10−5Kg/m (base)",
    "which is shifted toward high frequencies w.r.t. the classical range. This could be due to the fact that it is not easy to extract precise values of the parameters from Fig.2 of [NVTM03]. The range of frequencies covered by the model is adjusted by considering that •m(x)varies between 0.2×10−5Kg/m (base) to 2×10−5Kg/m (apex). •k(x)varies between 3.2×104Kg/(m sec2) (base) to .32Kg/(m sec2) (apex). Moreover, to fit hypothesis (A03), we consider h(x) = 2 .4×10−3Kg/(m sec ) (independently of x). We then get the parameters given at the end of Section 7.2. B Proof of Proposition 1 En(t)has the form En(ξ, t) =\u0010 (a1sin(k1t+α1) +a0sin(k0t+α0))2 + (b1sin(k1t+β1) +b0sin(k0t+β0))2\u0011 (44) where a1, a0, b1, b0, α1, α0, β1, β0are suitable functions depending on ξandn. Notice that the terms in b1and b0come from the term1 ξ2n2˙pn(t)2in formula (27). Moreover the term β1andβ0contains a factor π/2coming from the fact thatd dtsin(kt) =kcos(kt) =ksin(kt+π/2). Hence we can rewrite En(ξ, t)in the form En(ξ, t) =f0(t) +f1(t) +f2(t) +g0(t) +g1(t) +g2(t),where f0(t) =a2 0sin2(k0t+α0), f1(t) =a2 1sin2(k1t+α1), f2(t) = 2 a1a0sin(k1t+α1) sin(k0t+α0) 21 and similarly for g1, g2, g3. We have the following: Claim LethAandhBbe two periodic functions from RtoRwith angular frequencies ωAandωBand periods TA=2π ωAandTB=2π ωB. Assume that TA/TB=mA/mBwith mA, mBintegers and mA/mBan irreducible fraction. Then hA+hBis a periodic function with period 2π ωAmB=TAmB=TBmA=2π ωBmA STEP 1 (periodicity of f2)Using the formula 2 sin( a) sin(b) = cos( a−b)−cos(a+b)we have that f2is the sum of two periodic functions: one with angular frequency k1+k0and the other with angular frequency k1−k0. Moreover by hypothesis we have thatk1+k0 k1−k0=p qwith p > q integers andp qan irreducible fraction. Applying the Claim with ωA=k1+k0,ωB=k1−k0,TA/TB=k1−k0 k1+k0=q/pand hence mA=q,mB=pwe have that f2is periodic with period T2=TBmA=2π k1−k0q STEP 2 (periodicity of f0+f2). Using the formula sin2(a) =1 2(1−cos(2 a))we have that f0has angular frequency 2k0. Let us apply the claim with hA=f2, hB=f0, ωA= (k1−k0)/q, ω B= 2k0. Notice moreover that TA TB=2πq k1−k0 2π 2k0=2k0 k1−k0q=p−q (where in the last equality we have used the fact thatk1+k0 k1−k0=p qimplies 2k0=p q(k1−k0)−q p(k1+k0)). Hence we can take mA=p−qandmB= 1. Then f0+f2is periodic with period TAmB=2πq k1−k01. With a similar argument we conclude that f0+f1+f2is periodic with period2πq k1−k0. The same argument applies to g0+g1+g2and the conclusion follows.
