    "Quantum Purification for Amplitude Damping Noise Kai Wang1and Zhen-Yang Peng2∗ 1Interdisciplinary Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Wuhan College, Wuhan 430212,China 2Wilczek Quantum Center, School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240, China (Dated: September 9, 2025) Noise poses a fundamental challenge to quantum information processing, with amplitude-damping (AD) noise being particularly detrimental. Preserving high-fidelity quantum systems therefore relies critically on effective error correction and purification methods. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for mitigating AD noise that can be applied to both state and channel purification. Our method achieves a substantial enhancement in the fidelity of affected states or channels while main- taining a low resource overhead, requiring only one or two ancilla qubits in combination with two Clifford gates, and exhibits a relatively high success probability. This approach provides a practical and scalable framework for addressing AD noise in realistic quantum systems. I. INTRODUCTION Quantum information processing is fundamentally lim- ited by noise, which degrades the fidelity of quantum states and operations. Among various noise types, amplitude-damping (AD) noise is particularly detrimen- tal, as it models energy loss processes that occur in most physical implementations [1–3]. To achieve reliable quan- tum computation and communication, both quantum er- ror correction and quantum state purification are essen- tial. Quantum error correction [4] actively protects quan- tum information mostly by encoding logical qubits into redundant Hilbert spaces and detecting or correcting er- rors without directly measuring the encoded information [5–16]. There are also channel adapted codes designed specifically for AD noise [17–23]. In contrast, purification is a probabilistic procedure that increases the fidelity of a quantum state [24–27] or channel [28–32], typically by post-selecting measurement outcomes or averaging over multiple noisy copies. The latter approach is often re- ferred to as virtual purification, as it effectively improves only the fidelity of expectation values rather than pro- ducing an actual purified state [31–35]. Purification is particularly useful in scenarios where error correction is costly or impractical, such as near- term quantum devices with limited qubit resources [36], or when one seeks to distill high-fidelity states from mul- tiple noisy copies for tasks including entanglement dis- tribution [37–39], quantum communication [40], and cer- tain quantum algorithms [41, 42]. It is important to note that purification can be applied exclusively to pure states and cannot be directly used for mixed states, whereas er- ror correction can handle both scenarios, making error correction more broadly applicable. However, accord- ing to the Choi-Jamio lkowski isomorphism [43, 44], any quantum channel can be mathematically represented as a pure state. Combined with the complex circuits and large amounts of ancillas required for error correction, ∗pengzhenyang@sjtu.edu.cnleading purification a particularly efficient and practical approach for mitigating noise in both quantum states and high-dimensional channels. In this work, we focus on purification for AD noise, proposing a method applicable to both state and channel purification that enhances the fidelity of affected quan- tum systems using only a single or at most two an- cilla qubits and two Clifford gates: the Hadamard and controlled-Z gates.

    "purification for AD noise, proposing a method applicable to both state and channel purification that enhances the fidelity of affected quan- tum systems using only a single or at most two an- cilla qubits and two Clifford gates: the Hadamard and controlled-Z gates. Unlike previous purification methods that require multiple copies of the states to be protected, our circuit operates on a single noisy state, reducing the circuit dimension and thereby decreasing the likelihood of additional noise, while circumventing the limitations imposed by the no-cloning theorem [45]. Furthermore, the circuit can also be employed to probe the effects of AD noise. Our approach provides a practical and effi- cient strategy for mitigating dominant decoherence mech- anisms in realistic quantum systems. This paper is organized as follows. We begin in Sec- tion II with the necessary background information on the AD noise channel and a brief introduction to purifi- cation, establishing the notation and terminology used throughout the paper. In Section III, we introduce our setup for state purification and demonstrate how it can also be employed to probe AD noise. In Section IV, we extend the method to multi-qubit purification for noise with equal probabilities on each qubit, which also serves as a strategy for channel purification under AD noise. Section V presents numerical results evaluating both the fidelity of our methods, as well as the corresponding suc- cess probabilities, validating their effectiveness and effi- ciency. Finally, we conclude and summarize our work in Section VI. II. PRELIMINARY A. AD noise AD noise describes energy relaxation from the ex- cited state|1⟩to the ground state|0⟩due to system– environment coupling. In general, any quantum process can be modeled as a quantum channel Φ, also known asarXiv:2509.05709v1 [quant-ph] 6 Sep 2025 2 a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map [44]. Such a map can be expressed in terms of a set of Kraus operators{K i}as Φ(ρ) =X iKiρK† i,(1) whereP iK† iKi=Iguarantees complete positivity and trace preservation [46]. For the AD channelE AD, the Kraus operators are given by E0=\u0012 1 0 0√1−γ\u0013 , E 1=\u0012 0√γ 0 0\u0013 ,(2) whereγ∈[0,1] is the damping probability. Physically, γrepresents the probability that an excitation decays during the noise interval. B. Purification Suppose qubits are initially prepared in an unknown pure state|ϕ⟩. After undergoing noise, which can be de- scribed by a quantum channelC Ewith Kraus operators {Ki}, the state evolves into ρE=CE(|ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|) =X iKi|ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|K† i.(3) The central goal of purification is to recover the max- imum possible number of qubits in a state that is “as close as possible” to the original unknown state|ϕ⟩. The quality of purification is typically evaluated in terms of both the fidelity [1] between the original state |ϕ⟩and the purified stateρ, f(|ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|, ρ) =f(|ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|,C purify◦CE(|ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|),(4) where we useC purify to describe the overall purification procedure, and the probabilitypof successfully obtain- ing the desired outcome. These two criteria are often in competition: higher fidelity generally comes at the cost of a lower success probability, and vice versa. In practice, purification can be realized either through post-selection, where only favorable measurement out- comes are kept",
    "purification procedure, and the probabilitypof successfully obtain- ing the desired outcome. These two criteria are often in competition: higher fidelity generally comes at the cost of a lower success probability, and vice versa. In practice, purification can be realized either through post-selection, where only favorable measurement out- comes are kept while the rest states, severely affected by noise, are discarded, or through virtual purifica- tion, which consists of averaging over multiple noisy re- alizations to mitigate the average effect of the noise, thereby improving the fidelity of expectation values. Al- though virtual purification does not produce an actual high-fidelity quantum state, it is deterministic—no runs are discarded—and is therefore resource-efficient. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term experiments with limited samples, where full-fledged error correction is not yet feasible. By contrast, purification via post- selection has the key advantage of producing an actual purified quantum state, which can be directly reused in subsequent computational or communication tasks.Moreover, post-selection can in principle achieve higher fidelity with respect to the original state|ϕ⟩, since unfa- vorable noisy realizations are explicitly filtered out, albeit at the potential cost of reduced success probability. In this work, we achieve purification via post-selection. III. SETUP FOR STATE PURIFICATION Our circuit for state purification under AD noise is shown in Fig. 1, whereNrepresents the AD noise chan- nel. The first qubit serves as an ancilla: by measuring it and post-selecting on the desired outcome, the noise- induced errors on the second qubit can be detected and effectively filtered out, resulting in a purified state. FIG. 1. (Color online) Circuit for state purification under AD noise, whereNrepresents the AD noise channel and the first qubit serves as an ancilla. To illustrate the operation of the circuit, consider an arbitrary input state of the second qubit|ψ⟩. The output state of both qubits before measurement then is |ξ⟩=|+⟩ ⊗X i√piEi|ψ⟩+|−⟩ ⊗(ZX i√piEiZ)|ψ⟩, (5) where pi=⟨ψ|E† iEi|ψ⟩(6) denotes the probability that the noise channel acts through the Kraus operatorE i, whose explicit matrices are given in Eq. (2). Consequently, depending on the measurement outcome of the ancilla, the second qubit collapses to one of the corresponding conditional states: |0⟩:X i√piEi|ψ⟩+ (ZX i√piEiZ)|ψ⟩,(7) |1⟩:X i√piEi|ψ⟩ −(ZX i√piEiZ)|ψ⟩.(8) Noted for AD noise, its Kraus operators satisfy: [E0, Z] = 0,{E 1, Z}= 0,(9) which simply Eqs. (7) and (8) into: |0⟩:E 0|ψ⟩,(10) |1⟩:E 1|ψ⟩,(11) with the corresponding measurement probabilitiesp 0and p1, respectively. Therefore, by measuring the ancilla and 3 post-selecting on the|0⟩outcome, the circuit shown in Fig. 1 effectively realizes state purification under AD noise. A straightforward calculation shows that for any state to be purified,|ψ⟩=α|0⟩+β|1⟩, the probability of obtaining the ancilla measurement outcome|0⟩is p0=α2+ (1−γ)β2,(12) and the corresponding purified state of the second qubit, in its unnormalized form, is |ψ′⟩=α|0⟩+p 1−γ β|1⟩.(13) The fidelity of this purification is then given by f(|ψ⟩,|ψ′⟩) =|⟨ψ|ψ′⟩|2=(α2+√1−γ β2)2 α2+ (1−γ)β2.(14) Additionally, there exist some error-correction schemes for AD noise that require an estimation of the damping parameterγin advance [47, 48]. The circuit in Fig. 1 can also be used to estimate the strength of AD noise, since the measurement",
    "this purification is then given by f(|ψ⟩,|ψ′⟩) =|⟨ψ|ψ′⟩|2=(α2+√1−γ β2)2 α2+ (1−γ)β2.(14) Additionally, there exist some error-correction schemes for AD noise that require an estimation of the damping parameterγin advance [47, 48]. The circuit in Fig. 1 can also be used to estimate the strength of AD noise, since the measurement outcomes|i= 0,1⟩occur with proba- bilitiesp ias given in Eq. (6). Explicitly, fori= 0,1 we have p0=⟨ψ|\u0012 1 0 0 1−γ\u0013 |ψ⟩, p 1=⟨ψ|\u0012 0 0 0γ\u0013 |ψ⟩.(15) The parameterγcan then be directly estimated by preparing the input state of the second qubit as|1⟩. In this case, the probability of obtaining the outcome|1⟩is p1=⟨1|E† 1E1|1⟩=γ,(16) providing a straightforward probe of the AD noise strength. Moreover, onceγis estimated, one can fur- ther purify the second qubit in our setup by applying the non-unitary operator \u0012 1 0 0 1/√1−γ\u0013 ,(17) which compensates for the attenuation introduced by the no-jump operatorE 0, thereby restoring the relative weight of the excited state|1⟩. IV. SETUP FOR CHANNEL PURIFICATION We now extend our method to channel purification un- der AD noise. As established by the Choi–Jamio lkowski isomorphism, every quantum channel Φ can be uniquely represented by a corresponding Choi state, ρChoi= (I⊗Φ)|ϕ Bell⟩⟨ϕBell|,(18) where |ϕBell⟩=1√ 2(|00⟩+|11⟩) (19)denotes the maximally entangled Bell state [49]. Thus, by preparing the Choi state associated with the chan- nel to be purified, one can employ analogous purification strategies to mitigate AD noise in a quantum channel. The corresponding circuit is shown in Fig. 2, whereN denotes the AD noise channel, which may act on both input qubits. The region enclosed by the dashed line rep- resents the input Choi state of channelε, and the first qubit serves as an ancilla. FIG. 2. (Color online) Circuit for channel purification under AD noise, whereNrepresents the AD noise channel,εdenotes the channel to be purified and the first qubit serves as an ancilla. Consider an arbitrary input channelε, with its corre- sponding Choi state ρChoi=X m,n|m⟩⟨n| ⊗ε(|m⟩⟨n|) =X m,n|m⟩⟨n| ⊗X αKα|m⟩⟨n|K† α,(20) where{K α}denote the Kraus operators of the channel ε, andm, n= 0,1. The output state before measurement can then be expressed as |ξ⟩=X mX αX i,jh |+⟩ ⊗\u0000√pimEi|m⟩ ⊗√pjαmqαm· EjKα|m⟩\u0001 +|−⟩ ⊗\u0000√pimZEiZ|m⟩⊗ √pjαmqαmZEjZKα|m⟩\u0001i , (21) in terms of the probabilities pim=⟨m|E† iEi|m⟩,(22) qαm=⟨m|K† αKα|m⟩,(23) pjαm=⟨m|K† αE† jEjKα|m⟩,(24) which represent the probabilities associated with the Kraus operatorsE i,K α, and their combined action on the basis state|m⟩, respectively. For AD noise, a straightforward calculation gives p00= 1, p 01= 1−γ, p 10= 0, p 11=γ.(25) Depending on the ancilla measurement outcome, the sec- ond and third qubits collapse into the corresponding 4 post-measurement states: |0⟩:X mX αX i,j\u0010√pimEi|m⟩ ⊗√pjαmqαmEjKα|m⟩ +√pimZEiZ|m⟩ ⊗√pjαmqαmZEjZKα|m⟩\u0011 , (26) |1⟩:X mX αX i,j\u0010√pimEi|m⟩ ⊗√pjαmqαmEjKα|m⟩ −√pimZEiZ|m⟩ ⊗√pjαmqαmZEjZKα|m⟩\u0011 , (27) which can be further simplified under AD noise yielding |0⟩:X mX αh√p0mp0αmqαm\u0010 E0⊗E 0\u0011\u0010 |m⟩ ⊗K α|m⟩\u0011 +√γp1α1qα1\u0010 E1⊗E 1\u0011\u0010 |1⟩ ⊗K α|1⟩\u0011i ,(28) |1⟩:X mX αh√p0mp1αmqαm\u0010 E0⊗E 1\u0011\u0010 |m⟩ ⊗K α|m⟩\u0011 +√γp0α1qα1\u0010 E1⊗E 0\u0011\u0010 |1⟩ ⊗K α|1⟩\u0011i .(29) It is worth noting that error correction or purification is meaningful only when the noise probability is suffi- ciently small, i.e., in this case,",
    "0\u0011\u0010 |m⟩ ⊗K α|m⟩\u0011 +√γp1α1qα1\u0010 E1⊗E 1\u0011\u0010 |1⟩ ⊗K α|1⟩\u0011i ,(28) |1⟩:X mX αh√p0mp1αmqαm\u0010 E0⊗E 1\u0011\u0010 |m⟩ ⊗K α|m⟩\u0011 +√γp0α1qα1\u0010 E1⊗E 0\u0011\u0010 |1⟩ ⊗K α|1⟩\u0011i .(29) It is worth noting that error correction or purification is meaningful only when the noise probability is suffi- ciently small, i.e., in this case, the parameterγis rela- tively small. In this regime, the occurrence probability of p(E1⊗E 1)∝γ2is strongly suppressed, so that the first term in Eq. (28) becomes dominant. This suggests that by measuring the ancilla and post-selecting on the|0⟩ outcome, the circuit shown in Fig. 2 can realize channel purification under AD noise. We also note by using two ancillas and the method il- lustrated in Fig. 1, one can achieve purification of a two- qubit state, as shown in Fig. 3 (left). Since a two-qubit state and its corresponding Choi state are interchange- able, the same setup can also be employed to purify a quantum channel, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (right). FIG. 3. (Color online) Circuit for two-qubit state purification (left) and channel purification (right) under AD noise using two ancillas, whereNrepresents the AD noise channel and the first two qubits serve as ancillas. However, when ancilla resources are limited, the circuit depicted in Fig. 2 is more resource-efficient and practical. At the same time, this circuit can also be adapted for two-qubit state purification by replacing the Choi state with the input two-qubit state to be purified.For the circuit shown in Fig. 3, the measurement out- comes of the first two ancilla qubits determine the post- measurement state of the last two qubits. As expected, for an input state|ψ⟩of the last two qubits, the sys- tem collapses into the following states depending on the measurement outcome: |00⟩:E 0⊗E 0|ψ⟩, |01⟩:E 0⊗E 1|ψ⟩, |10⟩:E 1⊗E 0|ψ⟩, |11⟩:E 1⊗E 1|ψ⟩.(30) V. NUMERICAL CALCULATION To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we nu- merically calculate the fidelities using Eq. (4) as well as the probabilities of obtaining the desired measurement outcomes for different AD parametersγ. The circuit can be implemented directly or simplified beforehand using the ZX-calculus [50]. The results are shown in Fig. 4 for single-qubit state purification and in Fig. 5 for channel purification, both using one ancilla, and in Fig. 6 for two-qubit state purifi- cation using two ancillas. For all figures, the input states or channels are ran- domly sampled 1000 times for each chosen value ofγ. The blue dashed curves depict the average fidelity of the unpurified states under AD noise, while the blue solid curves correspond to the average fidelity after purifica- tion, i.e., conditioned on obtaining the ancilla measure- ment outcome|0⟩in the first two figures, and|00⟩in the last figure. The red dotted curves indicate the average probability of obtaining the corresponding favorable an- cilla measurement outcome. FIG. 4.

(Color online) Fidelity and probability as a function of the AD parameterγ. The blue dashed curve depicts the average fidelity of the unpurified channel under AD noise, the blue solid curve corresponds to the average fidelity after purification, and the red dotted curve represents the average probability of obtaining the ancilla measurement outcome|0⟩. FIG. 6. (Color online) Fidelity and probability as a func- tion of the AD parameterγ. The blue dashed curve depicts the average fidelity of the unpurified state under AD noise, the blue solid curve corresponds to the average fidelity after purification, and the red dotted curve represents the average probability of obtaining the ancillas measurement outcome |00⟩. We highlight the critical points in each figure where the fidelity after purification drops below 0.99. From the lo- cations of these points, it is evident that the single-qubit purification method is highly competitive, achieving very high fidelity- remaining above 0.99 even for a relatively strong noise parameter,γ= 0.4184- while simultaneously maintaining a reasonably high success probability, with more than 71.94% of runs yielding the desired measure- ment outcome. When AD noise acts on two qubits, fidelities above 0.99 are attainable only when the noise strength is sufficientlylow, specifically forγ <0.1333 when using a single an- cilla andγ <0.2667 when using two ancilla qubits. The corresponding success probabilities at these points are 85.47% and 70.90%, respectively. By introducing one additional ancilla qubit, the purification fidelity can be significantly enhanced, remaining above 0.95 even for a relatively strong noise parameter,γ= 0.5. However, this improvement comes at the cost of a decreased probability of obtaining the favorable ancilla measurement outcome, highlighting the inherent trade-off between purification fidelity and operational efficiency in the protocol. At the same time, it is straightforward to observe from Fig. 4 that the probability of obtaining the ancilla mea- surement outcome|0⟩is linearly anti-correlated with the AD parameterγ, in excellent agreement with our analyti- cal result given in Eq. (12). This behavior is also observed in the two-ancilla purification setup, as both configura- tions follow the same underlying purification logic. It is worth emphasizing that all success probabilities remain above 0.5, indicating that the proposed purification pro- tocol is not only effective in enhancing fidelity but also practical for experimental implementation. For two-qubit or channel purification, the circuits shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are essentially interchange- able. However, when the AD noise has a small damping parameter, it is more resource-efficient to perform purifi- cation using only a single ancilla. This approach not only ensures high fidelity but also offers greater operational efficiency compared to the two-ancilla setup, making it particularly suitable for low-noise scenarios. VI. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have proposed a method for AD pu- rification that requires at",
    "to perform purifi- cation using only a single ancilla. This approach not only ensures high fidelity but also offers greater operational efficiency compared to the two-ancilla setup, making it particularly suitable for low-noise scenarios. VI. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have proposed a method for AD pu- rification that requires at most two ancilla qubits and only two types of Clifford gates, namely the Hadamard and CZ gates. The method can be applied to both state and channel purification. Unlike previous purification strategies that require multiple copies of the states to be purified, our circuit operates on a single noisy state, reducing the circuit dimension and thereby decreasing the likelihood of additional noise. Furthermore, the cir- cuit can also be employed to probe the effects of AD noise. We numerically calculated the fidelity between the purified and original states (channels), as well as the corresponding success probabilities. Our results show that the proposed protocol achieves a substantial enhancement in fidelity while maintaining a relatively high success probability, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency for experimental implementa- tion. Since any quantum circuit can be decomposed into a sequence of single- and two-qubit gates, the purification of AD noise in single- and two-qubit systems serves as a natural benchmark for the design of large-scale noisy purification schemes. Overall, these findings represent an important step toward robust quantum information processing and demonstrate the effectiveness of noise- 6 adapted purification strategies in mitigating dominant decoherence mechanisms.
