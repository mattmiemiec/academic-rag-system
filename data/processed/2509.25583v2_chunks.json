    "Contact Forces in Microgel Suspensions Fran Ivan Vrban,1,∗Antonio ˇSiber,2, 3and Primoˇ z Ziherl1, 3 1Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Jadranska 19, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia 2Institute of Physics, Bijeniˇ cka cesta 46, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia 3Joˇ zef Stefan Institute, Jamova 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia (Dated: October 2, 2025) Within a model where micrometer-size soft colloidal particles are viewed as liquid drops, we theoretically study the contact interaction between them. We compute the exact deformation energy across a broad range of indentations and for various model parameters, and we show that it can be reproduced using truncated superball and spheropolyhedral variational shapes in the attractive and the repulsive regime, respectively. At large surface tensions representative of microgels, this energy is pairwise additive well beyond small indentations and can be approximated by a power-law dependence on indentation with an exponent around 2. Microgels are an important class of colloidal materials used in various applications [1, 2]. In many ways, these micrometer-size soft spheres are the opposite of hard-particle sols as a key paradigm in the field: In dense suspensions, they facet and partly interpenetrate [3]. Their de- formed shape suggests that one could model them as continuous bodies, say by borrowing results from the classical elasticity of solids. Indeed, the contact interaction between microgels is often de- scribed by the Hertz theory [4] which, however, only covers indentations up to about 10% [5] and does not include the surface energy. Surface energy is an essential component of the physics of colloids and microgels are no exception. Experiments [6] and simulations [7] show that mi- crogels stabilize the oil-water interface, implying that they have an effective surface tensionγ F even though their surface is not as sharp as in molecular liquids and solids. This has important implications. The surface energy of a microgel of radiusR ∗scales asγ FR2 ∗, whereas its bulk ener- gy is proportional toKR3 ∗whereKis the bulk modulus. The surface-to-bulk energy ratio reads γFR2 ∗ KR3∗=ℓS R∗,(1) ℓS=γF/Kbeing the elastocapillary length [8]. In microgels,ℓ Sis between 10 and 100µm [9] whereasR ∗is usually a few 100 nm. Thus ℓS/R∗>1, which shows that the mechanics of microgels is governed by surface tension. In ad- dition, the small size of these particles means that the stress within them is uniform rather than dis- tributed. These two conclusions are incompati- ble with the assumptions of the Hertz theory but are included in the liquid drop model where de- formable colloidal particles are viewed as com- pressible drops [10, 11]. This model is a gene- ralization of the foam theory of emulsions [12]known, e.g., for the Morse–Witten drop-drop in- teraction [13]. So far, the liquid drop model was primarily explored numerically [10, 11], its high-density variant explaining the existence of exotic crys- tals formed by nanocolloidal micelles [14]. Here we use it to theoretically study the contact in- teraction between microgels and other softµm- size particles.

We show that the exact deforma- tion energy can be reproduced by two variational shapes and that in the large-tension regime rep- resentative of microgels, it reduces to a simple power law and is pairwise additive. The liquid drop model.We start with the phenomenological free energy of a drop: F=V0 χT\u0012V−V 0 V0−lnV V0\u0013 +γFAF+γCAC 2. (2) The bulk term represents the Murnaghan equa- tion of state with a pressure that vanishes if the drop volumeVequals the reference volumeV 0; χTis the compressibility. In the surface terms, AFandA Care the areas of the non-contact do- main and the contact zones, respectively, andγ F andγ Care the corresponding tensions. The fac- tor of 1/2 in the last term appears because each contact zone is shared by two drops. The first dimensionless parameter of the model is the reduced Egelstaff–Widom length [10, 15] Ψ =2γFχT R0,(3) which encodes the relative volume decrease due to the Laplace pressure 2γ F/R0, whereby the re- ference radiusR 0= (3V 0/4π)1/3shrinks to the resting radiusR ∗(Fig. 1; Supplemental Material, Sec. I [16]); note that Ψ = 2ℓ S/R∗×R∗/R0. The second parameter is the tension ratio ω=γC 2γF.(4)arXiv:2509.25583v2 [cond-mat.soft] 1 Oct 2025 2 a b c R0γF=0 R* γF>0 γCγF FIG. 1.

Panel b shows the relationship between the reference and the resting drop, and panel c emphasizes the dif- ference of the contact and non-contact tension. Deformation free energy.We first compute the equilibrium drop shapes numerically using Surface Evolver [17] so as to obtain their deforma- tion free energy ∆Fdefined relative to the resting drop. This is done for a broad range of reduced Egelstaff–Widom lengths Ψ; Ψ≪1 and Ψ≫1 are referred to as the small- and the large-tension regime, respectively, the latter corresponding to microgels. We examine tension ratiosωboth lar- ger and smaller than unity, initially for drops in the simple cubic (SC) lattice where the coordina- tion numberz= 6. Figure 2a shows ∆Fas a function of dimen- sionless engineering indentation u=h R∗,(5) wherehis the displacement of the contact zone toward drop center. We present two datasets, one for Ψ = 10−3and the other for Ψ = 1, and we compare attractive drops withω= 0.8 to neutral and repulsive ones atω= 1 and 1.2, respectively. The two sets of data in Fig. 2a are qualitatively similar. Atω= 0.8, the drop-drop interaction is attractive at smallu; the attractive regime ex- tends to negativeuwhere the drops are pulled apart but form cohesive capillary bridges with each other. Atubeyond the minimum lies the repulsive regime where the drops are increasingly more faceted as illustrated by the Ψ = 10−3, ω= 0.8 sequence of variational shapes included in Fig. 2a and described below.

Variational shapes.The form of drops in con- tact seems deceptively simple (Supplemental Ma- terial, Sec. III [16]), and our next goal is to better understand it using variational approximations. Force balance at the edge of the contact zone gives cosθ=ωwhereθis the contact angle; thus in attractive drops whereω <1,θ < πwhereas in repulsive ones whereω >1,θ=π. This con- straint should be satisfied as best as possible by the variational shapes. We explore two ans¨ atze: Truncated super- balls and spheropolyhedra (Supplemental Mate- rial, Secs. V and VI, respectively; insets to Fig. 2a [16]). Unlike the Z-cone model [18], our shapes are smooth and closed and they include the trun- cated sphere (Supplemental Material, Sec. IV [16]) as a special case. The 6-pole superball com- patible with the SC lattice is defined by |x|m+|y|m+|z|m=Rm.(6) Form <2, the poles are pointed whereas for 3 m >2 they are squashed. The superball is trun- cated by removing pole caps and the thus formed contact zones are more or less circular as long as m≈2; the contact angleθ < π. Equation (6) can be modified to construct superballs with a different number and arrangement of poles [19]. The second shape studied is the spheropolyhe- dron, i.e., the polyhedron with rounded edges and vertices with the same radius of curvatureR edge. The shape of each contact zone is the same as that of the parent face and the contact angleθ=π. In the truncated variant where plane-parallel slices are removed from the faces,θ < πand the contact zones are polygons with rounded vertices. As evidenced by Fig. 2a, the exact deforma- tion",

As evidenced by Fig. 2a, the exact deforma- tion free energies are reproduced very well by truncated superballs and spheropolyhedra cove- ring the attractive and the repulsive regime, re- spectively. Equally impressive is the agreement of the truncated-spheropolyhedron and exact ∆F atω= 1 and Ψ = 10−3,10−2, . . .102shown in Fig. 2b, which spans many orders of magni- tude. A more detailed insight into this agreement is provided by Fig. 3 showing the relative diffe- rence of the two energies.

Scaling laws.Figure 2b emphasizes many fea- tures of the deformation free energy across a broad range of reduced Egelstaff–Widom lengths and indentations. Specifically, this figure shows that (i) for Ψ≲10−1, the small-indentation ∆Fis independent of Ψ and perfectly consistent with the Morse–Witten theory [13] whereas (ii) at the onset of complete faceting atu≳0.2, ∆Fin- creases in step-like fashion; (iii) atu≳0.3, ∆F∝1/Ψ for all Ψ; and (iv) at Ψ≳1, ∆F is proportional to 1/Ψ for allu. These scaling laws can be obtained analytically using suitable simplifications (Supplemental Material, Sec. VII [16]). Finally, we note that at Ψ≳1 andω≥1 ∆F zγFR2 0≈3uα Ψ,(7) whereαweakly depends on Ψ; at Ψ = 10 and ω= 1, e.g.,α= 2.28 (Supplemental Material, Sec. VIII [16]). Equation (7) holds to a good approximation for allu≲0.4. This result is of practical importance because it describes the drop-drop interaction in the regime pertaining to microgels. Many-body effects.The Morse–Witten theory is a key reference because it shows that at small tensions the drop-drop interaction is markedly many-body even at small indentations. To see whether this also holds at large tensions, we com- pare ∆F/zγ FR2 0in thez= 6 SC lattice and in thez= 4 diamond-cubic (DC) lattice; the dis- cussion is limited tou≲0.36 where a drop in the DC lattice presses on the 4 nearest neighbors but not on the 12 next-nearest ones.

The many-body effects are quantified using the relative difference of the deformation free energies per contact de- fined by Ξ = 1−(∆F/z) z=4 (∆F/z) z=6.(8) If the interaction is pairwise additive, Ξ = 0. Figure 4 shows Ξ obtained from the exact deformation free energies atω= 1 and Ψ = 10−3,10−2, . . .102. At Ψ = 10−3, Ξ is positive and increases withu ∗, nicely agreeing with the Morse–Witten result atu ∗≲0.1. As Ψ is in- creased to 10−1, Ξ remains qualitatively simi- lar but decreases in magnitude, which indicates weaker many-body effects. In large-tension drops with Ψ = 10, Ξ falls to less than 0.03 at all indentations considered, implying that the con- tact interaction is essentially pairwise additive; this holds at all Ψ≳10. This somewhat unex- pected behavior appears to originate in the bulk term dominated by work done against the refe- rence pressure, the relative pressure increase due to indentation being small, and in the drop radius virtually unaffected by indentation (Supplemen- tal Material, Sec. III [16]). These related effects arise from the resting state being determined by the balance of strong contractile surface-tension 4 ▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.3-0.200.20.40.60.8 uΞΨ=10-310-2 10-1 110 102Ψ=10-310-2 10-1 1 10 102Morse-Witten theory pairwise additivity FIG. 4.

The red line is the prediction of the Morse–Witten theory. forces and a large drop pressure, which is to low- est order independent of indentation. In contrast, in the small-tension regime the resting state is defined primarily by the volume constraint, and thus any drop-drop contact necessarily leads to a global deformation so that the interaction is many-body. —The values of Ξ computed using the truncated-spheropolyhedron model are sys- tematically smaller than the exact ones but their overall trend is the same. The deviation is largest at smallu, which is consistent with the lesser ac- curacy of the variational models at these inden- tations (Fig. 3) and the fact that Ξ is computed by subtracting one small value from another. Discussion.This work offers new insight into contact forces between large-tension drops repre- sentative of microgels. We show that within the liquid drop model, the deformation free energy is given by a power law ∆F∝uαwithα≈2, which holds well beyond small indentations—and that it is pairwise additive. These two features of the drop-drop interaction are especially impor- tant because theya posteriorijustify the assump- tions of theoretical studies that postulate pair- wise additivity and involve similar interparticle potentials (e.g., Refs. [4, 20, 21]), in particular the Hertz interaction characterized byα= 5/2. Our findings uphold the relevance of these studies for suspensions of deformableµm- and nm-size particles.

Our findings uphold the relevance of these studies for suspensions of deformableµm- and nm-size particles. Our second result is in showing that the trun- cated superball and spheropolyhedron shapes nicely capture the main morphological features of drops in the repulsive and the attractive regime, respectively, covering all stages of faceting. These variational shapes offer an evident computational advantage at a reasonable cost in accuracy. Sincethey are equally applicable to ordered and disor- dered local geometries, these shapes can be em- ployed for efficient computational studies of large assemblies of microgels where each particle would be represented by a spheropolyhedron based on its Voronoi cell; the geometry of such a scheme can be visualized by the network of Plateau bor- ders in wet foam [22]. From this perspective, our work paves the way to theoretical investi- gations of soft-particle suspensions at scales per- mitting studies of collective and emergent phe- nomena, possibly using more refined versions of the model with, e.g., curvature-dependent surface non-contact tension [23] and alternative types of bulk free energy.
