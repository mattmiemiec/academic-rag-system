    "A filter-dependent granular temperature model from large-scale CFD-DEM data L. Rosenberga, W.Fullmerb, S. Beetham1a aOakland University, Department of Mechanical Engineering bNational Energy Technology Laboratory Abstract The computational study of strongly-coupled, gas-solid flows at scales relevant to most environmentalandengineeringapplicationsrequirestheuseof‘coarse-grained’methodologies such as the two-fluid model, particle-in-cell approach or the multiphase Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations. While these strategies enable computations at desirable length- and time-scales, they rely heavily on models to capture important flow physics that occur at scales smaller than the mesh. To date, the models that do exist are based on a limited set of flow conditions, such as very dilute particle phase. To this end, we leverage the most large-scale repository of CFD-DEM data to date to develop a filter-size dependent model for granular temperature–a key quantity for accurately predicting gas-solid flows. This filter-size dependence then translates directly to grid-size dependence in the context of coarse-grained approaches. In addition, we leverage the CFD-DEM dataset to propose an improved model for the mean variance in particle volume fraction, a quantity that characterizes the degree of clustering in the flow. Keywords:Gas-solid flows, particle-laden, data-driven modeling, cluster induced turbulence 1. Introduction Gravity-driven, gas-solid flows are ubiquitous across both industrial and natural pro- cesses. For many of these flows, improving understanding of underlying flow physics and advancing our ability to tractably and accurately predict them is often either industrially relevant or socially critical. For instance, pyroclastic density currents are the gravity-driven flow of ash particles in hot gas and represent the most hazardous volcanic process (14). Gas- solid flows are also prevalent in a range of chemical engineering applications, including the circulating fluidized reactors used to upgrade various feedstock into fuel(3)(22). In nearly all applications of interest, an expansive range of both length and time scales is present and the physics proceeding at the small scales have important implications on large-scale behavior. This reverse cascade is in direct opposition to the traditional energy cascade established in single-phase turbulence (K41) theory (26). To this end, when particles are fluidized by a gas, the resulting multiphase flow is almost always complex and chaotic, 1Cooresponding author: sbeetham@oakland.eduarXiv:2509.10728v1 [physics.flu-dyn] 12 Sep 2025 generating heterogeneous structures commonly known as clusters in particle-dilute flows and bubbles in particle-dense flows (Agrawal et al. (1); Fullmer and Hrenya (19)). These structures often cause the development of turbulence in the gas-phase, which would not have otherwise been present in the absence of a particulate phase (sometimes termed ‘cluster induced turbulence’ (7)). For this class of flows, several approaches exist with varying degrees of accuracy and tractability. Particle-resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (PR-DNS)(33), allows for the resolution of particle-scale flow physics and requires very little modeling (e.g., only chem- ical kinetics, lubrication forces and collisions are modeled). While highly accurate, this approach is extremely limited to the number of particles in the system (O(103)), which in turn limits the domain size due to sub-particle scale resolution requirements, thus making PR-DNS intractable for systems of industrial interest. In order to enable the tractability of systems that are capable of exhibiting meso-scale structures such as clusters and bubbling, methods",
    "number of particles in the system (O(103)), which in turn limits the domain size due to sub-particle scale resolution requirements, thus making PR-DNS intractable for systems of industrial interest. In order to enable the tractability of systems that are capable of exhibiting meso-scale structures such as clusters and bubbling, methods such as unresolved Euler–Lagrange (EL), commonly referred to as Computational Fluid Dynamics–Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM), can be employed where models are introduced for particle-scale physics (e.g., drag models)(32). While these approaches enable the simulation of much more expansive systems, they still fall short of tractably capturing scales of interest. Extending the reliance on models even further results in techniques such as two-fluid or Euler-Euler (EE) models or Particle-In-Cell approaches (PIC). The former treats both phases in the Eulerian sense and requires several closures for the particle-phase, par- ticularly for drag, granular temperature and the particle stress tensor. While methods such as kinetic-theory based two-fluid models (e.g.,Garzó et al. (20)) are able to capture complex interactions between both phases and the development of heterogeneous structures, it takes a significant amount of resolution to do so Fullmer and Hrenya (17), Fullmer and Hrenya (18), making these approaches insufficient for capturing large-scale industrially-relevant problems. In the case of PIC, Lagrangian markers that exist at discrete points in space and time are used to represent parcels of potentially non-zero, non-integer numbers of particles. These parcels do not directly interact with each other, but instead communicate via a solids stress tensor that is computed based on the volume fraction(2)(30)(10). Given this context, improved models are the key hurdle preventing coarse grained ap- proaches from accurately resolving small-scale dynamics. Thus far, modeling has proved challenging with most efforts focused on the filtered (unresolved) drag force, e.g., Igci et al. (24), Igci and Sundaresan (23), Sarkar et al. (29), Ozel et al. (27), among many others. However, in addition to modeling the sub-grid drag force, another quantity of interest is also important for gas-solid flows–the granular temperature,Θ, a measure of the unresolved granular energy (21). In order to build a model that is more likely to be representative of a wide range of flow states and regimes, it is important to take into account highly-resolved data across each of these regions. To this end, the most expansive set of gravity-driven, gas-solid CFD-DEM data to date has been curated and used in this work to develop a filter-dependent granular temperature model. To this end, this paper is structured in the following manner: First, the concept of granular temperature and its relation to other fluctuating kinetic energy terms in the particle field is introduced in Sec. 2. Next, the system and properties of the CFD-DEM simulations used to produce the dataset used in this work is provided in Sec. 3. Finally, the data is analyzed in Sec. 4 culminating in the proposed granular temperature model, before 2 ending with summarizing remarks in Sec. 5. 2.

    "the data is analyzed in Sec. 4 culminating in the proposed granular temperature model, before 2 ending with summarizing remarks in Sec. 5. 2. A brief formalization of granular temperature While several extensive studies of granular temperature and its origins can be found in the literature (15), here we present a brief overview to support the modeling discussions presented in this work. The concept of granular temperature is rooted in Einstein’s 1905 postulation that macroscale dynamics of particles proportionally scales to molecular dynamics (12)(21). Flu- idized particulate (or any kind of granular gas) effectively embodies the same scaling of molecular behavior as a standard gas, however with some key nuances. Inter-particle colli- sions contribute to granular temperature in the same paradigm as inter-molecule collisions do in any other substance; the more collisions, the higher the rate of change of entropy versus the change in internal energy, and subsequently the higher the temperature. However in a departure from traditional molecular dynamics, inter-particle collisions are inelastic, therefore there is a requirement of a source of energy in a fluidized system to maintain the fluidization(21). In CFD-DEM, two-phase flows are solved by evolving the fluid on a mesh in the usual Eulerian sense and evolving the particles as discrete Lagrangian bodies subject to Newton’s second law. The phases are then coupled via interphase exchange terms (6). Due to this, Lagrangian quantities, such as the particle-phase velocity, can be decomposed as up=˜up+δu p,(2.1) whereu pdenotes the total, instantaneous particle velocity, ˜upis theEulerianparticle ve- locity andδu pis an uncorrelated, Lagrangian residual. The procedure for generating an Eulerian representation for Lagrangian quantities involves a two-step filtering operation and is described in detail in the literature (6) as well as Sec. 3. In this work, a Reynolds average is denoted with angled brackets,⟨·⟩, and fluctuations from Reynolds averaged quantities are denoted with a single prime. It is notable that be- cause the simulations carried out in this study are triply periodic and become statistically stationary in time, this average is carried out over all three spatial dimensions as well as time. Given this, the decomposition of the particle velocity,u p, is given asu p=⟨u p⟩+u′ pand the decomposition of the fluid velocity,u fis given asu f=⟨u f⟩+u′ f. It is notable that the Reynolds average of Eulerian quantities represents a volume average and a Reynolds average of a Lagrangian quantity represents an ensemble average,hPtf t=t0\u0010PNp i=1u(i,t) pdt\u0011i /(tf−t0), where the superscriptsi, tdenote thei-th particle at thet-th time step and the statistically stationary period is bounded byt 0andt f. Phase averaging (analogous to Favre averaging) is commonly used and results in phase- averaged equations, which enable multiphase turbulence modeling (4). These phase averages are denoted by⟨·⟩ fand⟨·⟩ pfor fluid and particle phase averages, respectively.

Because the particle-phase volume fraction,ε pis an Eulerian quantity, computed by pro- jecting the Lagrangian particle volume to the Eulerian grid via trilinear interpolation and 3 applying a Gaussian filter, whenarepresents a Lagrangian quantity, it must also be recast as an Eulerian field. Thus, there also exist fluctuations about the particle phase average, defined as ˜u′′ p= ˜up− ⟨˜up⟩p. Here, the phase average of these fluctuations is null (i.e.,⟨ ˜u′′ p⟩p≡0) but since ˜u′′ p̸=u′ p, then⟨ ˜u′′ p⟩ ̸= 0. Owingtothetwowaysinwhichtoviewparticle-phaseinformation(eitherLagrangianor Eulerian) and the two definitions of fluctuating particle phase velocity, the total fluctuating energy in the particle phase, e.g. the total granular energy,κ p(a Lagrangian quantity), can be decomposed as the sum of the particle phase turbulent kinetic energy (TKE),k p(an Eulerian quantity) and the phase-averaged granular temperature,Θ, as κp=k p+3 2⟨Θ⟩p.(2.2) Here, the total granular energy is a purely Lagrangian quantity defined as κp=1 2 u′ p·u′ p (2.3) and thus no information is lost via projection to the Eulerian grid. The particle phase TKE, kp, is purely Eulerian and analogous to the Reynolds Stress tensor thatArises in single-phase turbulence. It is defined as kp=1 2D ˜u′′ p·˜u′′ pE p.(2.4) Due to the projection and filtering required to computek pand the notion that ˜u′′ p̸=u′ p, this quantity is incapable of capturing thetotal granular energy. Instead,k prepresents the correlatedcontribution to total granular energy. Given this, anuncorrelatedcontribution to granular energy is required to resolve the proportion of granular energy thatk pcannot resolve due to the filtering operation. This term is the particle phase averaged granular temperature,⟨Θ⟩ p(7). Thisdistinctionisimportantinthecontextofcoarse-grainedmethods, suchastheEEor PIC formulations, where Lagrangian information is not available and must be reconstructed using the resolved portion of the granular energy (k p) and the granular temperature, which requires a model. Further, both of these quantities are directly tied to the filter size used to cast Lagrangian information as an Eulerian field, and thus the relative contribution of each is also intimately connected to the resolution, or filter size, of the Eulerian-based approach chosen. Given this,⟨Θ⟩ pcan be computed either fromκ pandk pby way of Eq. 2.2 or directly as ⟨Θ⟩p=1 3^δup·δu p,(2.5) wheree·represents the filtering operation andδu pis the Lagrangian fluctuations relative to the Eulerian particle velocity, ˜up. These two approaches of computing⟨Θ⟩ pare only equivalent when⟨u p⟩=⟨ ˜up⟩pholds, however, the range of conditions studied in this work indicates that the validity of this argument depends upon filter size. Thus, we compute the granular temperature by way of Eq. 2.2, using the known total granular energy and resolved contribution from TKE,k p, which varies depending on filter size. 4 3. Data and computational methodology The data that underpins the analysis and modeling efforts presented in this work comes from a recently completed CFD-DEM simulation campaign of cluster-induced turbulence (CIT). This phenomenon has been previously described in the literature (7) and repre- sents the cascade of turbulent energy from small to large scales due to strong coupling between the phases. In particular, in gas-solid flows with sufficiently high mass loading (φ= (ε pρp)/(ε fρf)≫1)",

This phenomenon has been previously described in the literature (7) and repre- sents the cascade of turbulent energy from small to large scales due to strong coupling between the phases. In particular, in gas-solid flows with sufficiently high mass loading (φ= (ε pρp)/(ε fρf)≫1) particles spontaneously form coherent structures in the form of clusters, largely due to the mechanism of reduced drag. This heterogeneity has been shown to generate and sustain turbulence in the gas phase, as the name CIT suggests. Tothisend, thesimulationcampaignconsideredatriplyperiodicdomainofprototypical gas and particles commonly found in industrial applications, such as circulating fluidized bed reactors (see Tab. 1). As with previous similar studies, e.g., Capecelatro et al. (5), CIT is considered in a triply-periodic, rectangular domain domain with an aspect ratio of four. All simulation properties are shown in Tab. 1.

The campaign consisted of 33 unique simulations sampled from a 2-D phase-space of mean solids concentration,⟨ε p⟩, and Archimedes number,Ar=ρ g∆ρ|g|d3 p/µ2 g. Mean parti- cle concentration ranged from 1% to 40% by changing the particle count from approximately 10 million to 400 million. The Archimedes number was adjusted by increasing the body force from one to five times standard gravity, rangingAr≈18toAr≈90. The body force was balanced by a mean pressure gradient. In order to prevent the state from drifting due to numerical imprecision, an additional constraint on particle velocity was applied. To this end, the mean (global) particle velocity was normalized to zero to double precision at an interval of every fluid time step. For consistency, this was applied in all three directions 5 giving⟨u p⟩= 0. We note here that due to the transfer kernel and (if used) filtering,⟨u p⟩p is negligibly small, though a few orders of magnitude larger than machine precision. Particles were initially seeded in a uniform hex-close packed lattice for all concentra- tions, rather than randomly distributed, for computational efficiency during initialization particularly at high volume fractions. Additionally, the particles were thermalized with an initial granular temperature of⟨Θ⟩= 0.01m2/s2for computational efficiency during startup. Inotherwords, theparticlesweregivenanoisyinitialvelocityinaneffortminimizetheinitial transient. Once a quasi-steady state was reached, which varies for each case and was determined “by eye,” AMReX-native plot files2were saved at regular intervals (everyτ p=m p/3πµ gdp= 0.02s), resulting in 100 snapshots of particle and fluid data during the statistically stationary period. All of the simulation snapshots, approximately 50 TB worth of binary plot file data, have been made openly available (16). The snapshots, i.e., AMReX plot files, were then post-processed with an AMReX-based application,postmfix, developed specifically for this purpose (16).

In addition to the total particle fluctuating kinetic energy,κ p(Eq. 2.2), and all particle properties were computed by post-processingthesimulationdatawiththesameeight-cell, trilineardepositionschemeused in the simulation code to generate Eulerian fields from Lagrangian data. The continuous particle (i.e., solids) data can also be further smoothed by applying a Gaussian filter, which is a focus of this work. We note here that the original CFD-DEM simulations utilized an eight-cell deposition scheme in the numerical solution and the filtering used here is purely a post-processing step. In this work, we employ a constant width filter, rather than a filter that varies based on the local volume fraction (13) (8) (9) and ensures a fixed number of particles in the filtering region. The motivation for this choice is the fact that the filtered CFD-DEM data is analogoustotheEulerianmeshspacingforacoarse-grainedCFDmethod, suchasEEorPIC. In such approaches, the fluid mesh is typically uniform, or refined based on geometry not adaptivelybasedonlocalvolumefraction. Thus,filteringthehighlyresolvedCFD-DEMdata using a fixed filter width is most closely aligned with the fluid grid-based resolution chosen in the coarse grained approaches, approaches that require granular temperature models that should properly depend upon grid size. 4. Clustering and granular temperature behavior Inthissection, weexamineboththeclusteringandgranulartemperaturebehavioracross the parameter space studied and for a range of filter sizes. In particular, quantities of interest are computed for each of the 33 flow configurations (sampled from theAr-⟨ε p⟩parameter space discussed previously) and are subsequently filtered, using thirteen filter sizes that vary from 2 to 128d pasδ i= 2·δ i−1, withδ 0= 2d p. This results in 429 data points. Sincethesimulationcampaignperturbedtwoparameters(volumefractionandArchimedes number,Ar), it is useful to first consider how the balance of granular temperature changes with the normalized filter size,δ⋆=δ/d p, as well as⟨ε p⟩andAr. As shown in Fig. 1 for three 2https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex 6 (a)δ= 2d p (b)δ= 24d p (c)δ= 128d p Figure 1: Normalized granular temperature dependence upon both⟨ε p⟩andArfor three representative filter sizes.

Here, the filter size,δis normalized byd p(δ⋆=δ/d p). The full dataset is displayed in each figure with gray circles and the dataset indicated in the caption is highlighted in red. Next, we consider the dependence of the relative contribution of granular temperature to the total granular energy as a function of filter size. We observe that with increasing filter size the particle velocities become less correlated and, thus, the correlated contribution toκ, i.e.,k p, decreases and the uncorrelated contribution,Θ, increases. This behavior is 7 shown in Fig 2 of Capecelatro et al.",
    "to the total granular energy as a function of filter size. We observe that with increasing filter size the particle velocities become less correlated and, thus, the correlated contribution toκ, i.e.,k p, decreases and the uncorrelated contribution,Θ, increases. This behavior is 7 shown in Fig 2 of Capecelatro et al. (7) and very similar behavior is observed in this data. We consider the ratio3⟨Θ p⟩/2κ p, which is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of filter size for all conditions with four cases highlighted in red. Here, we find that this dependence is monotonically but nonlinearly increasing. We also note that this trend that is consistent across the parameter space studied. In fact, it is more than consistent but nearly identical, i.e., sorting is independent ofδ⋆. In other words, most of the curves do not cross one another. However, this is not always the case, as highlighted in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2 also shows that, in general, the ratio decreases with increasing concentration, with the densest conditions lying at the bottom of the envelope of curves. Because the degree of clustering plays an important role in granular temperature of an assembly of particles, it is also relevant to consider the degree of clustering present in the flow. Here, we make use of the parameter,D, defined originally by Eaton and Fessler (11) as D=\u0010q ⟨ε′2 p⟩ − ⟨ε′2 p⟩|0\u0011 ⟨εp⟩≈q ⟨ε′2 p⟩ ⟨εp⟩(4.1) whereq ⟨ε′2 p⟩is the variance of the particle volume fraction of the fully-developed configu- rations andq ⟨ε′2 p⟩|0is the variance of the volume fraction of anuncorrelatedassembly of particles (i.e., the initial configuration in this simulation campaign), which is assumed to be null. Given this definition,Dwill become increasingly large with higher deviations from an uncorrelated state, thus indicating the degree of clustering. In the work of Issangya et al. (25), a model for the variance of particle volume fraction was formulated as D= 1.584 [(1−ε mf)− ⟨ε p⟩](4.2) = 1.584(ε mp− ⟨ε p⟩)(4.3) whereε mfandε mprepresent the theoretical maximum volume fractions in the fluid and particle phases, respectively. In Issangya et al. (25),ε mfwas measured to be 0.55 which is a typical fluffed packing in practice, i.e., in a real system. However, the underlying data in this case comes from CFD-DEM simulations in which the particles are perfectly spher- ical, monodisperse and smooth. Therefore, we have changedε mfto the spherical random close-packed limit of 0.64 in our proposed improved model in addition to fitting the leading coefficient to the most highly resolved data in this study (corresponding to a filter size of δ= 2d p). Thus, we propose an adjusted model, given by D= 2.4(ε mp− ⟨ε p⟩)(4.4) = 2.4(0.64− ⟨ε p⟩)(4.5) This model and the data that it was based upon is shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c). After applying increasingly large filters, we observe a flattening of this curve, indicative of the loss of information at the sub-filter scale, as expected (see Fig. 3(a)). Since this quantity is unclosed no matter the filter size, only a single model is needed. Thus, we use the most highly-resolved data,",

Finally, since granular temperature represents theunresolvedcontribution to the total granular energy, it is useful to understand at what filter size this term dominates the balance. In other words, at what filter size does3⟨Θ p⟩/2≥k p? This can be determined by identifying the intersection of these two curves as a function of the normalized filter size,δ⋆, for each configuration. An exemplary case is shown in Fig. 4. Here, we denote this critical filter size asδ⋆ 50. Given this, it is interesting to note that the value ofδ⋆ 50is relatively consistent in the ‘mid range’ of volume fractions considered (i.e.,0.05≤ ⟨ε p⟩ ≤0.25). In this regime, the granular temperature becomes dominant at filter sizes larger than≈60d p. Interestingly, the granular temperature does not become dominant until the filter size is very large in the dilute and dense limits and for differing reasons. For a constant filter size in dilute suspensions, the filter size must get increasingly large in order to average a sufficient number of particles to attain a granular temperature that is half of the total fluctuating kinetic energy. On the other hand, for dense suspension, the heterogeneous state is one of dense regions near maximum packing and dilute regions (bubbles). Hence, while a filter located in a dense region may have an inordinate number of particles in it, it must grow large enough to the encompass macroscopic heterogeneity. 4.1. A filter-dependent model for granular temperature In a prior study by Tang et al. (31), a model for granular temperature was postulated through the definition of a granular temperature-based Reynolds number, defined as ReΘ=ρgdpp ⟨Θ⟩p µg.(4.6) Based on a PR-DNS study of gas-solid flow with elastic collisions, a model for Re Θwas formulated as ReΘ\u0012 Re,ρp ρg\u0013 = 2.108Re0.85 prρp ρg(4.7) with the particle Reynolds number defined as Rep=ρgdp(1−ε p)|⟨u p⟩ − ⟨u g⟩| µg.(4.8) 9 (a)δ⋆for(⟨ε p⟩, Ar) = (0.04,91.8) (b) The relationship betweenδ⋆ 50and⟨ε p⟩ Figure 4: The filter size at which granular temperature dominates the total granular energy is consistent for mid-range volume fractions, but increases asymptotically for dilute and dense assemblies.

(31) held even for this substantially larger CIT data. However, the leadingcoefficientandexponentneededtobeadjusted. Itwasalsofoundthattheadjustment was different depending on whether or not a filter was applied. Here, we consider a wide rangeoffiltersizes, mentionedpreviously, andattempttofitthesecoefficientsasacontinuous function. Specifically, we seek to fit ReΘ(δ⋆) =A Θ(δ⋆)ReBΘ(δ⋆) prρp ρg,(4.9) where the coefficientsA ΘandB Θboth depend upon the filter size,δ⋆. To carry this out, Re pand Re Θwere computed based on the resulting data from the configurations studied. For each configuration, these quantities were computed over the range of filter widths studied (see two exemplary cases in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b)). Then, for each filter size, constant values forA ΘandB Θwere determined by regressing the CFD-DEM data against the functional form of the model in Eq. 4.9. This process resulted in unique values forA ΘandB Θfor each filter size (e.g., unique values forA ΘandB Θdescribe the curves in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)). Thus, in order to collapse both into coefficients into functions dependent uponδ⋆rather than discrete values for each filter size, we then considered the dependence ofA ΘandB Θon filter size,δ⋆(see Fig. 6). Here, we note thatA Θhas a linear relationship onδ⋆, given as AΘ= 0.03(0.003δ⋆+ 0.72).(4.10) The dependence ofB Θis slightly more complex, and is given as BΘ= 0.49 exp (−0.0016δ⋆)−0.24 exp (−0.0316δ⋆).(4.11) Because Re Θdepends upon both Re pandδ⋆, comparing the proposed model with the ground truth CFD-DEM data can be represented as either a 3D surface (see Fig. 5(c)) or a 2D color plot (see Fig. 7). In the former, we demonstrate the spread of the data both 10 (a) Data with filter sizeδ⋆= 8 (b) Data with filter sizeδ⋆= 96 (c) Data with filter sizeδ⋆= 96 Figure 5: CFD-DEM data (symbols) are compared against the original model of Tang et al.

Note, the representative planes shown in (a) and (b) are called out in the three dimensional plot of (c). above and below the surface of the model prediction. It is notable that the computational campaign that serves as the basis for model development varied both volume fraction as well as Archimedes number. As previously discussed, the dependence of granular temperature on Archimedes number was weak, though this dependence introduces a degree of stochasticity. This can be seen both in the scatter of the CFD-DEM data in the 3D plot of Fig. 5(c) as well as in the 2D color plot of Fig. 7(a). We emphasize here that the original model of Tang et al. (31), which was derived based onhomogeneousPR-DNS data, only needed to be recast to be representative of thehetero- geneousCIT data studied in this work and includes dependence upon filter size.

The proposed model has a global mean error, defined as Egm=|ReΘ−Remodel Θ| ReΘ(4.12) of 20% relative to the underlying CFD-DEM data (the RMSE is 21%). As shown in Fig. 7(c), thisislargelyduetolargererrorsinregionswhereArchimedesnumber-baseddeviationsoccur in the data.

Conclusion In this work, we present the most extensive, highly-resolved CFD-DEM study of gran- ular temperature to date. This study considers the behavior of granular temperature with consideration given to volume fraction, Archimedes number and filtering size. As a part of this work, we propose a more widely applicable closer for the degree of clustering parameter, 12 D, which now can capture clustering behavior for gravity-driven gas-solid flows up to the limit of close packing. Further, we observe that the PR-DNS model for granular tempera- ture, originally developed by Tang et al. (31), correctly predicted the functional dependence between Re Θand Re p. However, the coefficients informed by PR-DNS fall short of being predictive for large-scale behavior that captures mesoscale behavior such as clustering. As such, we proposefilter-dependentclosures for the original coefficients in Tang et al. (31) and achieve marked improvement over the existing model. This work represents an initial step in developing improved closures to enable more accurate coarse-grained simulations of strongly- coupled, gas-solid flows, and future work is aimed at developing similarly filter-dependent closures for other important parameters such as particle drag.
