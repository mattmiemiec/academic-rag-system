    "LegalChainReasoner: A Legal Chain-guided Framework for Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation Weizhe Shi1*, Qiqi Wang2*†, Yihong Pan1, Qian Liu1†, Kaiqi Zhao3† 1The University of Auckland, New Zealand 2Nankai University, China 3Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China {wshi590, ypan317}@aucklanduni.ac.nz qiqi.wang@nankai.edu.cn liu.qian@auckland.ac.nz zhaokaiqi@hit.edu.cn Abstract A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge’s disposition of a case, including the de- cision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such opinions can assist in analyz- ing sentencing consistency and provide judges with references to similar past cases. However, current research typically approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning and sentencing prediction. This sep- aration often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowl- edge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To ad- dress these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultane- ously produces both legal reasoning and sen- tencing decisions. To achieve this, we intro- duce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that ap- plies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our ap- proach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation. Experi- ments on two real-world and open-source Chi- nese legal case datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models1. 1 Introduction In criminal judicial systems, particularly within Civil Law jurisdictions, legal judgments inher- ently integrate two inseparable elements: struc- tured legal reasoning and consequent sentencing de- cisions (Cui et al., 2023). This integration reflects the fundamental nature of judicial decision-making, where sentencing conclusions must be derived from *Equal contribution. †Corresponding author. 1The code and data used in this paper will be released after paper acceptance. Figure 1: Comparison between traditional approaches and the real-world practice. In traditional approach, legal reasoning and sentencing prediction are treated as separate tasks with independent models. In contrast, real-world judicial practice jointly consider these into a unified process, where sentencing decisions are derived from and justified by reasoning applied to case facts. and justified by systematic application of statutory provisions to established facts. Despite this intrin- sic connection, current LegalAI research artificially divides this coherent process into isolated tasks. The legal reasoning task (Ye et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2024a; Yue et al., 2024) focuses exclusively on constructing plausible arguments without addressing sentencing implications, while the sentencing prediction task (Liu et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2021a; Sun et al., 2024) gen- erates penalty terms without providing necessary legal justifications. This separation creates two crit- ical problems: (1) reasoning models may produce analyses inconsistent with the possible sentencing outcome, and (2) prediction models generate sen- tences lacking transparent legal foundations. Such fragmentation fundamentally contradicts the judi- 1arXiv:2509.00783v1 [cs.CL] 31 Aug 2025 cial principle that sentencing must be grounded in and justified by proper legal reasoning. Beyond the task separation, two additional limi- tations have also occurred in existing approaches. First, most of the legal knowledge incorporated in",
    "transparent legal foundations. Such fragmentation fundamentally contradicts the judi- 1arXiv:2509.00783v1 [cs.CL] 31 Aug 2025 cial principle that sentencing must be grounded in and justified by proper legal reasoning. Beyond the task separation, two additional limi- tations have also occurred in existing approaches. First, most of the legal knowledge incorporated in current methods remains manually designed and relatively simplistic (Gan et al., 2021). Methods using such knowledge often rely on predefined rules or direct citations of legal provisions rather than abstracting essential reasoning patterns. This surface-level integration fails to capture the deeper logical structures underlying legal judgments, lim- iting models’ ability to generalize across cases with subtle yet legally significant distinctions. Besides, current approaches lack explainability in both tasks, particularly in sentence prediction. Some stud- ies have attempted to introduce manually defined generation processes to improve explainability in reasoning generation (Xu et al., 2024). Neverthe- less, most existing research on sentence prediction primarily focuses on extracting semantic features from factual information, often overlooking the underlying reasoning mechanisms and the inter- pretability of the predicted outcomes. This limits the transparency and trustworthiness of these mod- els, especially in the criminal domains. To address these fundamental limitations, a novel Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task is proposed in this paper, wherein legal reason- ing and sentencing prediction are integrated into one paradigm like human judges, as illustrated in Figure 1. This task offers two significant advan- tages: (1) sentencing predictions become explicitly grounded in legal reasoning, enhancing both in- terpretability and jurisprudential validity; and (2) the approach mirrors authentic judicial processes, where verdicts are derived through structured legal analysis rather than isolated numerical predictions. To solve this task, we propose the LegalChain- Reasoner, a comprehensive framework comprising two principal components: the Structured Legal Chain and Chain-Aware encoding method. The Structured Legal Chains are developed by trans- forming statutory provisions into premise -situation - conclusion triplets, based on the Legal Norm the- ory (Keuth, 1975; Raz, 1980). These chains for- malize implicit legal inference patterns into explicit structured representations, enabling the model to learn step-by-step judicial decision-making pro- cesses. The Chain-Aware encoding with multi- linear transformation layers is designed to cap- ture complex relationships between legal elementswhile applying crime-specific reasoning transfor- mations, resulting in an effective jurisprudential alignment with established judicial reasoning pat- terns. The main contributions of this work are: •We define a criminal judicial opinion gener- ation task that produces legal reasoning and sentencing prediction in a single process. The task ensures the predictions are supported by judicial analyses. •We reveal the importance of structured legal chains in supporting interpretable and reli- able judicial opinion generation. By formaliz- ing statutory provisions into premise-situation- conclusion triplets, we propose a chain-aware encoding method that effectively helps reason- ing in the judicial decision-making process. •We evaluate our proposed method on two open-source, real-world datasets and achieve improvements in both the quality of generated judicial opinions and sentencing prediction. 2 Methodology Task Definition Given a set of criminal legal case factual descriptions F={F1, F2,···, Fi,···}, the Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task is formulated as the process of generating judicial",

The task can then be defined as the function f:Fi→Oi. The judicial opinion Oiincludes the case reasoning and sentence prediction. Overall Framework The fundamental principle of our method lies in mirroring authentic judicial processes, producing comprehensive judicial opin- ions that jointly consider both reasoning and sen- tencing in accordance with established legal prin- ciples. Figure 2 presents the overall framework of the proposed method, LegalChainReasoner. The framework consists of the Legal Chain construc- tion and the Chain-Aware Encoding modules. The Legal Chain construction addresses the need for for- malized legal knowledge representation. By trans- forming legal provisions into structured premise- situation-conclusion triplets, complex legal condi- tions and their relationships are explicitly formal- ized, enabling the model to learn step-by-step judi- cial decision-making processes. The Chain-Aware Encoding module leverages these structured chains 2 Figure 2: The overall architecture of LegalChainRea- soner. In the first module (top), legal chains are con- structed from statutory provisions. These chains are then processed in the Chain-Aware Encoding module (middle). Finally (bottom), the fused legal knowledge representations are integrated with case fact embeddings through the LLM to generate judicial opinions. to guide the opinion generation process. This spe- cialized mechanisms is integrated with case fact embeddings before being passed to the language model. Through this architecture, ensuring the criminal judicial opinion generation process is ex- plicitly grounded in proper legal analysis. 2.1 Legal Chain In criminal law practice, judges typically derive case outcomes through a structured reasoning pro- cess. This process traditionally follows a syllogistic pattern (Dai et al., 2025), where major premises (statutory provisions) and minor premises (factual descriptions) are combined to reach judicial de- cisions, encompassing both legal reasoning and sentencing. However, judges do not apply statutory provisions in their raw form, as these provisions of- ten contain complex structures, including multiple conditional clauses and nested relationships. To navigate this complexity, legal norm theory (Keuth, 1975; Raz, 1980) offers a principle that decom- poses each statutory provision into one or more triplets, each comprising a premise, a situation, and a conclusion . In the context of criminal law, these triplets capture the constitutive elements of a crime and the conditional factors affecting sentenc- ing. Judges typically select and apply the most rel- evant triplet during the reasoning process to reach a legally sound and context-appropriate judgment. To align with real-world judicial practice, we propose using the triplet structure, premise - situation -conclusion , as a means of integrating le- Figure 3: Legal Chain construction process with the robbery provisions.

    "-conclusion , as a means of integrating le- Figure 3: Legal Chain construction process with the robbery provisions. The original statutory provision (top) is decomposed into structured premise-situation- conclusion triplets (bottom). gal knowledge into language models for generating judicial opinions. We refer to this triplet as a Legal Chain , which aims to formalize the implicit reason- ing patterns embedded within statutory provisions into explicit, structured representations, enabling models to learn the step-by-step judicial decision- making process. Figure 3 illustrates an example of the legal chains for robbery . Formally, for each criminal charge C, all relevant statutory provisions defined within the legal domain are denoted as SP = {SP1, SP 2,···, SP j,···}. They are systemati- cally decomposed into a set of legal chains ΦC= {ϕ1, ϕ2,···}, where each legal chain ϕ∈ΦCis represented as a triplet ⟨p, s, c⟩. Here p(premise) represents a condition derived from legal facts, typ- ically characterizing a legal element or prerequisite that must be satisfied; s(situation) captures the consequences and severity assessments, reflecting nuanced legal requirements where multiple factors must be considered simultaneously; and c(con- clusion) specifies a sentencing recommendation directly grounded in statutory provisions. Current works utilize various forms of legal knowledge, such as legal graphs (Zhong et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021), prediction processes (Xu et al., 2024), and explanations of statutory provi- sions (Yue et al., 2021a). However, most of these approaches rely on manually designed structures or expert annotations (Chalkidis et al., 2019), which significantly increase the cost of incorporating le- gal knowledge and may result in unstable model performance when the knowledge is incorrect or of low quality. To address this, we propose an auto- matic extraction process for Legal Chains. This pro- cess transforms statutory provisions into structured triplets through a prompt-based extraction method- ology using large language models. The extraction 3 prompts are carefully designed with constraints to ensure that the resulting chains maintain both legal accuracy and structural consistency. The complete prompt template and its constraints are provided in Appendix A. The generated Legal Chains are subsequently validated by legal experts to ensure their fidelity to the original statutory provisions. Then, for a factual description Fiand its corre- sponding criminal charge Ci, a set of legal chains ΦCi={ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕ n}is constructed, where eachϕjrepresents a distinct decision-making path- way. We did not focus on charge determination, because recent works demonstrate significant profi- ciency in determining applicable criminal charges, with accuracy rates more than 95% in criminal charge determination (Hu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2022; Le et al., 2020). Based on this established capability, we focus on more challenging task of generating cohesive judicial opinions that jointly consider both reasoning and sentencing. When ap- plied to the Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task, the criminal judicial opinion generation func- tion can then be expressed as fCJOG(Fi, Ci,ΦCi). 2.2 Chain-Aware Encoding To better make models understand legal chains ΦCi, we propose a Chain-Aware Encoding Module to leverage these chains for the Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task. For a given criminal charge Ci, each chain",
    "the criminal judicial opinion generation func- tion can then be expressed as fCJOG(Fi, Ci,ΦCi). 2.2 Chain-Aware Encoding To better make models understand legal chains ΦCi, we propose a Chain-Aware Encoding Module to leverage these chains for the Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task. For a given criminal charge Ci, each chain ϕj=⟨pj, sj, cj⟩in the set ΦCiis embedded by first tokenizing and then averaging the token em- beddings for each component. epj=1 |pj|P t∈pjEbase(t), (1) esj=1 |sj|P t∈sjEbase(t), (2) ecj=1 |cj|P t∈cjEbase(t), (3) where, Ebaserepresents the token embedding func- tion of language models. These component embed- dings are then concatenated to form a chain repre- sentation Hϕj= [epj;esj;ecj]∈R3×d, where d is the model’s hidden dimension. To capture interactions between the elements of each legal chain, we apply self-attention mecha- nism: Aϕj,wϕj=MultiHeadAttn (Hϕj), (4) MultiHeadAttn (Hh ϕj) =Atten (Hh ϕj,Hh ϕj,Hh ϕj),(5) where Aϕj∈R3×dis the attended output repre- sentation, wϕj∈R3×3represents the attentionweights between chain components, and hmeans heads of multi-head Attention. A residual connection preserves both the original and attention-weighted information: A′ϕj=Hϕj+ Aϕj. This attended representation is then pooled to obtain a single vector representation rϕj∈Rd for each chain. After obtaining the processed chain represen- tation rϕj, as different types of criminal charges require distinct reasoning patterns based on their statutory provisions and jurisprudential traditions. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) (Ma- soudnia and Ebrahimpour, 2014; Cai et al., 2024), we design a crime-specific transformation layer to capture specific information. In addition, we in- troduce a general transformation layer to extract shared, generalizable features. We refer to this module as the crime transformation block, which processes the chain representations. The general transformation first applies to all criminal charges: TG(rϕj) =WG2·ReLU (WG1·rϕj+bG1) +bG2,(6) where WG1,WG2∈Rd×dare weight matrices andbG1,bG2∈Rdare bias vectors. Then, for each criminal charge Ci, a dedicated transformation is applied to the generally transformed representation: TCi(TG(rϕj)) =WCi·TG(rϕj) +bCi, (7) where WCi∈Rd×dandbCi∈Rdare charge- specific parameters that encode reasoning patterns unique to each crime type. These transformations are then combined through a gating mechanism to determine the appro- priate balance between general and crime-specific reasoning: G(TG(rϕj)) =σ(Wg·TG(rϕj) +bg), (8) tϕj=G(TG(rϕj))⊙TCi(TG(rϕj)) + (1−G(TG(rϕj)))⊙TG(rϕj),(9) where σis the sigmoid function that produces content-dependent interpolation weights. After applying transformations and the gating mechanism, each chain representation is processed through a final fusion layer that combines the origi- nal and transformed representations: fϕj=Wfusion·[rϕj;tϕj] +bfusion, (10) where Wfusion∈Rd×2dandbfusion∈Rdare learn- able parameters. 4 The final chain representation for all chains is then constructed: EChain= [fϕ1;fϕ2;...;fϕn]∈Rn×d, (11) where nis the number of chains in ΦCi. 2.3 Judicial Opinion Generation The factual description Fiis embedded using the same embedding layer of language model, and then integrated with the chain representations: ECombined = [EChain;HFi]∈R(n+lFi)×d, (12) where HFi∈RlFi×drepresents the embedded to- kens of FiandlFiis the sequence length. This integrated representation is processed by the lan- guage model to generate the judicial opinion ˆO: ˆO=fCJOG(Fi, Ci,ΦCi) =LLM(ECombined ). (13) The entire framework is optimized to jointly con- sider both sentencing prediction accuracy and rea- soning quality. The loss function is defined as: Ltotal=αLReasoning +βLSentencing , LReasoning =−1 NNX i=1CX c=1Oi,clog(ˆOi,c), LSentencing =−1 NNX i=1CX c=1Si,clog(ˆSi,c),(14) where SandˆSare the sentencing",

In the legal AI domain, there is only one publicly accessible dataset that includes both judicial reasoning and final decisions. It is con- structed based on Legal AI Challenge 2021 (LAIC- 2021), which contains Chinese criminal cases fea- turing factual descriptions, court reasoning, and sentencing outcomes. To ensure a fair comparison during training, we select crime types with more than 500 cases, resulting in approximately 12 dis- tinct crime categories. The detailed statistics of the datasets are provided in Appendix B. To further assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we collect a more complex and up-to-date set of cases of the same crime types from the People’s Court Case Database2, denoted as PCCD. The new 2Cases on the People’s Court Case Database ( https:// rmfyalk.court.gov.cn ) are selected and published by the Supreme People’s Court of China. These cases are intended to guide lower courts in adjudicating similar cases.dataset includes 100 representative cases (balanced across the 12 crime types) and is used for zero-shot validation, meaning it serves solely to evaluate the models trained on the LAIC-2021. Baselines. Considering recent studies ，we se- lect two types of baselines for a fair compari- son. First, we evaluate several natural language generation models, including AttS2S (Bahdanau et al., 2015), BART (Lewis et al., 2020), Llama-3.2- 3B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), DeepSeek-R1-Distill- Qwen-7B (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), and Lawyer- Llama-13B-V2 (Huang et al., 2023), on the com- plete judicial opinion generation task. In addition, we include several widely used and representa- tive methods in sentencing prediction as baselines, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), fine-tuned BERT (BERT-FT), Electra (Clark et al., 2020), R- Former (Dong and Niu, 2021), NeurJudge (Yue et al., 2021a), and ML-LJP (Liu et al., 2023). Fur- ther details are provided in Appendix C. Evaluation metrics. Since the Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task primarily involves gener- ating text, it can be evaluated using standard and widely adopted text generation metrics, such as ROUGE-1/2/L (Lin, 2004), BLEU-1/2/N (Papineni et al., 2002), BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020a), and GPTScore-pairwise (Li et al., 2024b). Addition- ally, as sentencing prediction involves numerical outputs, we employ two commonly used regression evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Further de- tails are provided in Appendix D. Implementation. We apply our LegalChainRea- soner to Llama-3.2-3B, DeepSeek-R1-Dstill-Qwen- 7B and LawyerLlama-13B-V2. We utilize the Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022) to fine- tune these LLMs. The setting of LoRA is the same as the previous LLM study in LegalAI (Xu et al., 2024). We set 8 heads for the multi-head atten- tion mechanism and 0.1 dropout. As the LReasoning already include",

We apply Adam optimizer with learning rates at 10−5level. All the experiments were conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB memory. 3.2 Comparison among Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation Tables 1 and 2 present the performance compar- isons between the proposed method and baseline 5 Table 1: Performance comparison on the LAIC-2021 dataset.

Across both datasets, the Lawyer Llama variants consistently outperform others, likely due to their pretraining on legal-specific corpora. A performance gap is observed between LAIC-2021 and PCCD across all methods, characterized by higher prediction errors and lower generation qual- ity scores. There are three reasons: (1) PCCD contains more complex cases, as it is published to guide judges; (2) it includes a higher proportion of appellate and final ruling cases involving multiple legal considerations; and (3) these cases need more complex legal reasoning. When comparing different types of legal knowl- edge incorporated into LLMs, our proposed legal chain fusion method outperforms models using only statutory provisions or vanilla LLMs. Notably, while fine-tuning a legal-domain LLM can be ben- eficial, it is not always efficient. By integrating our legal chain approach with general-purpose LLMs such as Llama and DeepSeek, we achieve better per- formance than the entire fine-tuned Lawyer Llama.

This perfor- mance gap highlights the importance of incorpo- rating structured legal knowledge for accurate sen- tencing prediction. Moreover, it demonstrates that our approach not only provides good quality legal reasoning but also outperforms models specifically designed for sentencing prediction. Among the sentencing prediction models, Neur- Judge (Yue et al., 2021a) demonstrated the strongest performance, followed by ML-LJP (Liu et al., 2023), while the remaining models per- formed considerably worse.

    "Neur- Judge (Yue et al., 2021a) demonstrated the strongest performance, followed by ML-LJP (Liu et al., 2023), while the remaining models per- formed considerably worse. These results differ from those reported in the original papers. Since our formulation treats sentencing prediction as a re- gression task rather than a classification task, using discrete ranges to represent numerical outcomes may obscure finer-grained differences in model performance and limit the ability to fully assess each model’s predictive capability. It is noteworthy that the simple incorporation of statutory provisions without structured reason- ing chains produced inconsistent results. In some cases, such as with Llama-3.2-3B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), direct addition of statutory provisions actu- ally degraded sentencing accuracy. This observa- tion underscores the insufficiency of merely expos- ing models to legal text without proper structuring of the reasoning process. 3.4 Ablation Study Table 4 shows the comparison for different com- ponents in the proposed method, LegalChainRea- soner, in Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task based on the Llama-3.2-3B. Overall, only using all components can achieve better results. Incorporating statutory provisions alone created \"legal knowledge overload,\" improv-Table 5: Case Study Evaluation Results for Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation Model Defendant Situation Sentencing Combined Accuracy Accuracy Accuracy Performance (%) (%) (%) Score (%) AttS2S 8.45 42.26 76.15 2.72 BART 99.50 65.27 12.22 7.93 Lawyer-Llama-13B-V2 99.08 56.82 71.30 40.12 + Statutory provisions 99.41 63.18 74.39 46.66 + LegalChainReasoner 99.41 67.20 78.49 52.39 ing text generation but degrading sentencing pre- diction due to lack of structured guidance. When fusing legal chains as plain text, more balanced performance was achieved as the premise-situation- conclusion structure provided effective reasoning pathways. When using the proposed legal chain- aware encoding method, performance can be fur- ther enhanced by capturing interdependencies be- tween legal elements. 3.5 Case Study Rule-based Screening. To evaluate the quality of generated judicial opinions, we design a rule- based screening method that assesses the content across three critical dimensions: defendant identifi- cation accuracy, situation description correctness, and sentencing range appropriateness. More details are provided in Appendix D.5. Table 5 shows that while most models achieve high accuracy in de- fendant identification, significant differences occur in situation description and sentencing accuracy. LegalChainReasoner demonstrates better perfor- mance in situation description while maintaining strong accuracy in sentencing, resulting in the high- est overall combined performance score. Case Demonstration. Figure 4 and Appendix E present several concise comparisons of outputs from different models in three types of crimes. Fig- ure 4 only shows the summarization of the gen- erated output; the full output is shown in Table 7. From these cases, we find the AttS2S generated opinion completely misclassifies the crime as fraud rather than robbery, incorrectly identifies the de- fendant as \"Li XX,\" and fails to acknowledge key elements such as the use of violence or threats, de- 7 Model Defendant Reasoning Sentencing AttS2S Incorrect Incorrectly identifyMisclassified Fraud instead of robberyInconsistent Sentencing inconsistent with reasoning BART Correct Correctly identifyCorrect Used violence and threats to robInconsistent Sentencing inconsistent with reasoning and ac- tual sentencing range Lawyer- Llama- 13B-V2Correct Correctly identifyCorrect Used violence and threats to robConsistent",

Wearing masks and armed with knives and pickaxe handles, they threatened [staff] and robbed over 300 yuan in cash from the station. At approximately 1:00 on January 3, the aforementioned individuals drove to the Shell gas station on East Ring Road in Bazhou City and used the same methods to rob over 1,000 yuan in cash. The stolen money has been spent.

The BART (Lewis et al., 2020) generated opinion correctly identifies the defen- dant and crime type but recommends a signifi- cantly lower sentence (30 months) than the statu- tory minimum (36 months), as Chinese Criminal Law Article 263 explicitly stipulates that robbery offenses shall be punished by \"fixed-term impris- onment of not less than three years and not more than ten years.\" This legal inconsistency demon- strates the critical limitations of approaches lacking legal reasoning for ensuring sentencing determina- tions comply with basic statutory requirements. In contrast, the LegalChainReasoner generated opin- ion demonstrates comprehensive coherence across all dimensions. It correctly identifies the defen- dant and crime type, acknowledges the use of vio- lence and threats, and recommends a sentence (48 months) that, while slightly higher than the actual sentence, remains proportionate to the case severity and logically aligned with the presented reasoning. These findings show that the proposed method enables the model to maintain consistent alignment between fact analysis, legal reasoning, and sentenc- ing determination. 4 Related Work Legal Reasoning Generation Several studies have formalized legal reasoning as a text-to-text natural language generation task, proposing various approaches to enhance performance. Early work applys sequence-to-sequence models to generatelegal reasoning (Ye et al., 2018). Subsequent re- search leveraged pre-trained language models such as BART (Lewis et al., 2020), including versions fine-tuned on legal datasets (Yue et al., 2021b), as well as large language models (Xu et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024). Beyond language model applications, recent studies have incorporated different forms of legal knowledge, either implicitly or through explicit processing. This includes multi-step rea- soning (Wu et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2024) and le- gal provisions understanding (Li et al., 2024a; Yue et al., 2024). However,",
    "Yue et al., 2024). Beyond language model applications, recent studies have incorporated different forms of legal knowledge, either implicitly or through explicit processing. This includes multi-step rea- soning (Wu et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2024) and le- gal provisions understanding (Li et al., 2024a; Yue et al., 2024). However, integrating preprocessed legal knowledge presents several challenges. First, reliance on human experts for annotation and vali- dation incurs high costs, limiting scalability. Then, preprocessing steps may introduce biases or over- simplifications, reducing the robustness of gener- ated reasoning, especially using the LLMs. Legal Sentencing Prediciton Legal sentencing prediction in criminal domains targets predicting prison terms. Several types of models are used in this task, including word-to-embedding methods like the Word2Vec-based approach combined with legal corpora (Xia et al., 2019), RNN-variants (Xu et al., 2020), language models (Zhang et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024) and LLMs (Deng et al., 2024). The knowledge used in this area can also be divided into explicit and processed categories. The pro- cessed knowledge includes explanatory statutory provision (Yue et al., 2021a) and statute embed- dings (Meng et al., 2025), similar cases retrieved through Case Triple Modeling (Zhang et al., 2023). 5 Conclusion This paper introduces the Criminal Judicial Opin- ion Generation task to bridge the gap between legal reasoning and sentencing in current works by aligning them with actual judicial workflows. To address this and flexibly fuse legal knowledge, the LegalChainReasoner framework is proposed, which models statutory provisions as structured legal chains and applies a chain-aware encoding method to capture legal logic and charge-specific reasoning. Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese criminal cases show that LegalChainReasoner improves both reasoning qual- ity and sentencing accuracy, whether the complete judicial opinion generation task or a single task. This work marks a step forward in building models that generate judicial opinions with stronger legal coherence and real-world applicability. 8 Limitations While LegalChainReasoner demonstrates signif- icant improvements in criminal judicial opinion generation, there are two limitations in evaluation methodology and temporal considerations. While our automated evaluation using LLMs provides scalability, it may not capture all nuances of legal reasoning that human judges would con- sider. The combined accuracy metric, though com- prehensive, treats all three components (defendant identification, situation description, and sentencing range) as equally important, which may not reflect actual judicial priorities. The dataset used in this study reflects legal prac- tices and interpretations from a specific time pe- riod. Legal frameworks evolve over time through legislative amendments and changing judicial in- terpretations. The model’s ability to adapt to such temporal shifts in legal understanding without re- training remains unexplored.

Figure 5 illustrates the prompt structure used for extracting legal chains from statutory provisions. While the extraction prompts are designed to en- force five essential constraints: •Exhaustiveness : All distinct behaviors and conditions specified in the statutory provision must be represented in the extracted chains. •Semantic separation : Premises must capture behavioral elements, while situations must fo- cus exclusively on consequential states or cir- cumstances. •Logical coherence : Complex conditions are represented through explicit logical operators (AND/OR), ensuring preservation of the orig- inal provision’s inferential structure. •Referential specificity : Any pronouns or in- direct references in the statutory text must be replaced with their specific content to elimi- nate ambiguity. •Sentencing specificity : Conclusions must di- rectly correspond to legally prescribed sen- tencing ranges without logical decomposition. We asked legal experts to evaluate the generated legal chains using the prompt shown in Figure 5. Across all 12 crime categories, the generated legal chains achieved an accuracy of 97.68%. This high accuracy indicates that the proposed prompt effec- tively generates accurate legal chains. Moreover, our construction method allows legal knowledge 11 Table 6: Statistics of the Datasets LAIC-Train LAIC-Test PCCD Total Cases 33,841 1,200 100 Text Length (Characters) Fact Description Average 548.6 509.6 394.0 Median 321.0",

B Datasets We utilize two open-source, real-world datasets: the Legal AI Challenge 2021 (LAIC-2021) and the People’s Court Case Database (PCCD). Both datasets contain cases published by courts in China. The key difference is that the PCCD dataset was curated by the Supreme People’s Court of China in 2023 and is intended to guide judges in handling similar cases. Therefore, the cases of PCCD are much more complex, and the number of cases is much smaller than LAIC-2021. Statistics for the two datasets are shown in Table 6. C Baelines We selected two types of baselines to compare with our method: Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation and Sentencing Prediction. Since the legal reason- ing generation task is a text generation task, the models used are primarily language models, which can also be applied to the Criminal Judicial Opin- ion Generation task. Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation task. Based on prior work in legal reasoning gen- eration, we selected several recent and influ- ential natural language generation models as baselines, including AttS2S (Bahdanau et al., 2015), BART (Lewis et al., 2020), Llama-3.2- 3B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), DeepSeek-R1-Distill- Qwen-7B (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), and Lawyer- Llama-13B-V2 (Huang et al., 2023). Sentencing Prediction We selected language models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), fine- tuned BERT (BERT-FT), and ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020); manually designed knowledge-based methods like NeurJudge (Yue et al., 2021a) and ML-LJP (Liu et al., 2023); and case-based methodssuch as R-Former (Dong and Niu, 2021). D Evaluation Metrics We select several types of evaluation metrics to as- sess the quality of the generated judicial opinions. D.1 Numerical Evaluation For sentencing prediction, we do not set the task as a classification problem. Although prior work has often formulated sentence length prediction as a classification task by discretizing prison terms into predefined categories, we argue that this ap- proach introduces several limitations. First, dis- cretization can result in the loss of fine-grained information, especially when sentence lengths vary continuously across a wide range. This may ob- scure meaningful differences between cases with similar but not identical sentence durations. Sec- ond, the boundaries between categories are often arbitrary and may not reflect real-world sentencing practices or legal standards, potentially introducing bias or reducing interpretability. Finally, treating the task as regression allows for a more precise, data-driven estimation of sentence length, which aligns better with the inherently continuous nature of the sentencing variable. Therefore, we adopt a regression-based formulation and evaluate per- formance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). D.2 Lexical Evaluation To assess the quality of legal reasoning genera- tion from",
    "estimation of sentence length, which aligns better with the inherently continuous nature of the sentencing variable. Therefore, we adopt a regression-based formulation and evaluate per- formance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). D.2 Lexical Evaluation To assess the quality of legal reasoning genera- tion from a lexical perspective, we utilize standard n-gram overlap-based metrics. Specifically, we use ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L to mea- sure unigram, bigram, and longest common sub- sequence overlaps, respectively. Additionally, we report BLEU-1, BLEU-2, and BLEU-N scores to evaluate n-gram precision at different levels. These metrics capture surface-level similarity between the generated and reference texts. D.3 Embedding Evaluation To assess semantic similarity beyond surface-level lexical overlap, we utilize BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020b), which leverages contextualized em- beddings from pre-trained transformer models to compare generated and reference judicial opinions. This metric captures deeper semantic alignment and is particularly effective in identifying meaning- preserving variations that traditional n-gram-based metrics may overlook. 12 Figure 6: GPTScore-pairwise Prompt. D.4 LLM-based Evaluation To evaluate the logical consistency and legal sound- ness of the generated content, we adopt an LLM- based assessment method known as GPTScore (Fu et al., 2024). This approach leverages large lan- guage models to assess the overall quality of gen- erated judicial opinions. Following recent re- search, we employ the GPTScore-pairwise (Li et al., 2024b) variant, which has been shown to be more effective. This method compares multiple generated texts and selects the best output. Figure 6 illustrates the prompt used for pairwise comparison, based on prior work. Table 1 and 2 show the scores of each model on GPTScore-pairwise. Due to the page limit, we report the average scores of AttS2S and BART. The AttS2S and BART scores of Table 1 are 0.0/0.0/0.0 and 9.87/21.68/28.97, respectively. The AttS2S and BART scores of Table 2 are 2.0/1.0/1.0 and 11/29/35, respectively. D.5 Rule-based Evaluation We design a rule-based method to evaluate the in- formation consistency between the reference and generated judicial opinions. This method focuses on three key aspects: defen- dant, situation, and sentencing. First, we compare the defendant’s name (e.g., \"Li XX\") to ensure it is consistently represented in both the reference and generated opinions. Second, we assess whether both opinions describe the same situation, based on structured legal chains extracted from the statutory provisions. Finally, given the situation mentioned in the generated opinion, we verify whether the pre- dicted sentence aligns with the expected sentencing level for that situation. The final consistency score is computed by mul- tiplying the individual accuracies of the defendant, situation, and sentencing components.

In November 2014, the defendant defrauded Victim C of 240,000 CNY by claiming he could arrange employment for Victim C’s son. In February 2017, the defendant defrauded Victim D of 220,000 CNY on three occasions by claiming he could help with certain matters. In total, Defendant A committed three instances of fraud amounting to 620,000 CNY . Opinion 本院认为，公诉机关指控被告人A以非法占有为目的，虚构事实，隐瞒真相，多次骗取他人财 物，数额特别巨大的事实，有经过庭审核实的证据予以证实，A的行为构成诈骗罪，公诉机关指 控的犯罪事实和罪名成立。关于A辩解称，其没有承诺为C儿子办工作，收到C24万元系借款，其 行为不构成诈骗罪的意见，经审理认为，被害人C、证人E、证人F证言均证实A谎称能为C儿子办 工作，C共给付A24万元，书证收据（欠条），载明为出款人孩子办工作；短信截图证实A谎称 为C儿子办理工作，让C拿钱的事实，上述证据能够形成完整证据链条，足以证实A谎称能为C儿 子办工作，诈骗C24万元的事实，故A的辩解不成立；关于A辩解称，其在D处分三次拿22万元 后让G拿走了，钱没花着，不能认定其构成诈骗罪的辩护意见，经审理认为，被害人D的陈述、 证人G的证言均证实将22万元交付给A，且G对A称其将22万元借走一事予以否认亦无证据证实， 故A的辩解不成立。被告人A诈骗被害人B案系刑满释放后五年内重新犯罪，是累犯，应当从重处 罚；被告人A如实供述诈骗被害人B的罪行，可以从轻处罚。依照《中华人民共和国刑法》第二百 六十六条、第六十五条第一款、第六十七条第三款、第五十二条、第五十三条、第六十四条之规 定，判决如下：判处有期徒刑138个月。 This court holds that the prosecution’s charges against Defendant A—that with the purpose of illegal possession, he fabricated facts, concealed the truth, and repeatedly defrauded others of property in an especially",

Defendant A’s actions constitute the crime of fraud, and the prosecution’s charges regarding the criminal facts and offense are established. Regarding Defendant A’s defense that he did not promise to arrange employment for Victim C’s son and that the 240,000 CNY received from Victim C was a loan rather than fraud, the court finds that testimonies from Victim C, Witness E, and Witness F all confirm that Defendant A falsely claimed he could arrange employment for Victim C’s son, and Victim C paid Defendant A 240,000 CNY in total. Documentary evidence including receipts (IOUs) indicate the money was for arranging employment for the payer’s child. Text message screenshots confirm Defendant A’s false claims about arranging employment and requesting money from Victim C. This evidence forms a complete chain sufficient to prove that Defendant A defrauded Victim C of 240,000 CNY by falsely claiming he could arrange employment for Victim C’s son. Therefore, Defendant A’s defense is not established. Regarding Defendant A’s defense that after receiving 220,000 CNY from Victim D in three installments, he let Witness G take it away and did not spend the money himself, thereby not constituting fraud, the court finds that testimonies from Victim D and Witness G confirm that 220,000 CNY was given to Defendant A, and Witness G denies Defendant A’s claim that he borrowed the 220,000 CNY . There is no evidence to support Defendant A’s claim, so his defense is not established. The defendant committed the fraud against Victim B after being released from prison for less than five years, making him a recidivist, which warrants a heavier punishment. The defendant truthfully confessed to defrauding Victim B, which warrants a lenient punishment. In accordance with Articles 266, 65(1), 67(3), 52, 53, and 64 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, the judgment is as follows: 138 months of fixed-term imprisonment. 15 Component Content Evaluation Metrics Defendant Defendant A Reasoning Multiple defrauded others of property (three separate victims); Especially large amount (620,000 CNY) Sentencing 138 months of imprisonment Generated Opinions AttS2S Opinion: The Court holds that Defendant Z , with the purpose of illegal possession, used methods of fabricating facts and concealing the truth to defraud others’ property ,with the amount being large .

Between March 10-13, 2017, Person B transferred contractual payments totaling 1.5 million yuan to Defendant A’s account in three separate bank transfers, which Defendant A misappropriated to repay bank loans. From April 21 to May 9, 2017, Person B transferred housing sales proceeds totaling 1.06 million yuan from Branch Y of Company X to Defendant A’s account in six installments. Defendant A used 850,000 yuan of these funds to repay personal loans and for personal expenses. The funds were returned before the case was filed. Further investigation revealed that the victims, Company X and its Branch Y , have both expressed understanding toward Defendant A Opinion 本院认为，被告人A利用职务之便挪用资金，数额较大，犯罪事实清楚，证据确实、充分，其行 为构成挪用资金罪。公诉机关指控的罪名及事实成立，本院予以确认。被告人A到案后如实供述 自己的罪行，可从轻处罚。被告人A获得被害人谅解，可酌情从轻处罚。公诉机关的量刑建议符 合法律规定，本院予以确认。辩护人关于被告人如实供述、获得被害人谅解、认罪认罚可从轻处 罚的辩护意见予以采纳。辩护人关于起诉书指控第一起被告人挪用150万元不应认定及第二起犯 罪数额应为45万元的辩护意见，经查与事实不符，不予采纳。根据被告人犯罪的事实、犯罪的性 质、情节和对于社会的危害程度，依照《中华人民共和国刑法》第二百七十二条、第六十四条、 第六十七条第三款之规定，判决如下：判处有期徒刑7个月。 This court holds that Defendant A took advantage of his position to misappropriate funds in a relatively large amount.
