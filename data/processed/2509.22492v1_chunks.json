    "On an optimization framework for damage localization in structures∗ Owais Saleem†1, Tim Suchan‡1, Natalie Rauter§1, and Kathrin Welker¶1 1Helmut Schmidt University/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering, Holstenhofweg 85, 22043 Hamburg, Germany Abstract Efficientstructuraldamagelocalizationremainsachallengeinstruc- tural health monitoring (SHM), particularly when the problem is cou- pled with uncertainty of conditions and complexity of structures. Tra- ditional methods simply based on experimental data processing are of- ten not sufficiently reliable, while complex models often struggle with computational inefficiency given the tremendous amount of model pa- rameters. This paper focuses on closing the gap between data-driven SHM and physics-based model updating by offering a solution for real-world infrastructure. We first concentrate on fusing multi-source damage-sensitive features (DSF) based on experimental modal data into spatially mapped belief masses to pre-screen candidate damage lo- cations.

It has rapidly evolved into a cornerstone of Industry 4.0 for critical in- frastructure, employing advanced sensor networks, realtime big data analytics, and digital twins to enable truly predictive maintenance. A classical SHM lifecycle— often referred to as the Rytter scheme [22]—comprises four stages: detection, lo- calization, quantification, and prognosis. Our hybrid FEM–experimental modal analysis (EMA) framework focuses squarely on the second and third stages, i.e., on accurately pinpointing damage sites and assessing their severity. Industry 4.0 has shifted SHM from passive inspections into active intelligence systems, in which edge-computing devices preprocess streaming measurements and cloud platforms run high-fidelity simulations in parallel. In this context, damage localization and quantification becomes the linchpin: accurate spatial mapping of defects not only triggers focused maintenance actions, but also refines the digital twin for continuous model updating. Damage localization in SHM has been approached from both model-based and data-driven perspectives, and there are modal-static hybrid and uncertainty- quantification schemes: •Model-based approaches: FEM-based model updating formulates damage lo- calisation as an inverse problem in which selected model parameters (e.g. element stiffness reductions, local flexibility or boundary properties) are ad- justed to minimise discrepancies between measured and simulated dynamic observables (natural frequencies, mode shapes, frequency response functions or FRFs) [11]. Sensitivity-based modal updating and least-squares formu- lations provide efficient gradient information for Gauss–Newton or Leven- berg–Marquardt solvers in modal and FRF objectives [20]. FRF-based and hybrid FRF/modal updating schemes have been shown to improve locali- sation",
    "and simulated dynamic observables (natural frequencies, mode shapes, frequency response functions or FRFs) [11]. Sensitivity-based modal updating and least-squares formu- lations provide efficient gradient information for Gauss–Newton or Leven- berg–Marquardt solvers in modal and FRF objectives [20]. FRF-based and hybrid FRF/modal updating schemes have been shown to improve locali- sation sensitivity to local stiffness changes in beam studies [31]. Practical two-step and substructural updating strategies have also been demonstrated for laboratory and field-scale validation of damage-localisation procedures [19]. •Data-driven methods: Autoregressive and statistical pattern-recognition al- gorithmsdetectdamagebymonitoringshiftsintime-seriesmodelcoefficients. In [18], an Auto-Regressive with exogenous inputs (ARX)-based prediction model whose residual-error statistics serve as damage indicators is proposed. Vector auto-regressive moving-average (VARMA) and stochastic subspace methods for damage detection and localization under unknown excitation are reviewed in [3]. Moreover, empirical-mode decomposition is combined with VARMA to define a damage index in operational environments (cf. [6]). Evidence-based fusion via Dempster–Shafer theory has been shown to be ef- fective for structural damage localization in beam-type systems. First, [8] demonstrated—through a simulation study—how damage sensitivity theory can combine modal residuals to pinpoint damage in an Euler-Bernoulli beam, achieving high localization accuracy under varying noise levels. Then, [1] extends this framework by formulating basic belief assignments from mode- shape and frequency changes and applies Dempster’s rule to detect dam- age in lab-scale structures, which shows improved robustness compared to 2 traditional probabilistic methods. In addition, [17] further enhanced dam- age sensitivity-based identification by integrating Shannon-entropy-weighted evidence fusion, which adaptively discounts conflicting or low-information features, yielding more reliable damage indices in both simulation and exper- imental validations. •Modal–static hybrids and uncertainty-aware schemes:Modal-curvature ap- proaches compare experimentally measured and analytically computed cur- vature fields to highlight local stiffness changes and produce damage indica- tors. In [7], the fusion of changes in low-order modal parameters with higher- order or complementary information to improve localization and diagnosis is discussed. A framework for assessing the robustness of SHM technologies that emphasizes principle feature selection, classifier choice and uncertainty- informed decision making is presented in [27], thus motivating the fusion of multiple feature types (e.g., static, dynamic or statistical) under noisy conditions. Finally, [16] introduces a four-node quadrilateral inverse-shell element with drilling degrees of freedom for iFEM/shape sensing, demon- strating improved full-field reconstruction, which is useful for sensing and damage assessment in plates and composite panels. Both the power and the limitations of a standalone inverse FEM-based damage quantification framework is discussed and demonstrated and a novel framework is introduced. This new framework concentrates on fusing multi-source damage- sensitive features based on experimental modal data into spatially mapped belief masses to pre-screen candidate damage locations. The resulting candidate damage locations are integrated into an inverse Finite Element model calibration process. Even though our approach provides a general framework for structures, we con- sider beam-like structures that extend only in one dimension for simplicity reasons, with the goal of detecting local damage. The previously-mentioned simulations will be using an Euler-Bernoulli beam model, which is described by the partial differential equation with the spatial coordinatexand timet, i.e., ρ(x)A(x)∂2w(x,t) ∂t2+∂2 ∂x2/parenleftbigg E(x)I(x)∂2w(x,t) ∂x2/parenrightbigg =q(x,t).(1) Here,ρ(x)denotesthedensityoftheconsideredmaterial,A(x)isthecross-sectional area,w(x)is the beam",

The partial differential equation also requires boundary and initial con- ditions, which depend on the specific setting that is simulated. Damage is then described by damage parametersθ—common choices are Young’s modulus, den- sity, or a combination of both. It may be noted that out of the two candidates for damage modelling (Young’s modulus and density), it is well established that a crack significantly influences the former while mass distribution remains virtually unchanged, cf., e.g., [4]. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework which addresses Rytter stages 2 (localization) and 3 (quantification), fusing full-field reconstructions with modal indicators under a Dempster-Shafer filter to yield both precise damage maps and severity estimates. The paper is organized as follows: The fundamentals of Dempster-Shafer the- ory is explained in Section 2. Here, two sources of damage are considered: modal 3 strain energy change ratio (MSECR) and a flexibility-based index. The two sources are fused and a more condensed plausibility information is utilized for localization. Section 3 defines our objective for the optimization process and discusses the op- timization strategy along with the chosen algorithm. The damage quantification approach for purely FEM-based optimization is discussed, along with its limita- tions, and two new strategies are formulated and implemented: the hierarchical approach and the coupled DS-FEM approach. In Section 4, we present numerical results for each implemented strategy: evidence-theoretic localization, pure FEM- based localization and quantification, and the fully coupled Dempster-Shafer and FEM framework. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the findings, discusses practical implications for SHM, and outlines directions for extending the hybrid framework. 2 Damage localization based on evidence theory Within this work, the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory [5, 24] is used in the context of damage detection. DS evidence theory extends classical Bayesian inference by permitting belief mass to be assigned not only to single hypotheses but to sets of hypotheses, thereby explicitly representing ignorance when evidence is inconclusive. The theory is briefly introduced in the following. 2.1 Fundamental definitions Let the frame of discernment Θ ={H 1,...,Hn} be the set of all possible mutually exclusive outcomes or hypotheses for a given situation, where the power set2Θcontains all subsetsA⊆Θ, including the empty set. In this context a basic probability assignment (BPA) or mass function m: 2Θ→[0,1] with the properties /summationdisplay A⊆Θm(A) = 1andm(∅) = 0, assigns the exact belief mass assigned to each subsetAand no other subset [24]. One defines the belief and plausibility from the massmof anyA⊆Θas Bel(A) =/summationdisplay B⊆Am(B), Pl(A) =/summationdisplay B∩A̸=∅m(B). Moreover, if A= Θ\\Adenotes the complement ofAin the frameΘ, then the plausibility can be written as Pl(A) =/summationdisplay B∩A̸=∅m(B) = 1−/summationdisplay B⊆Am(B) = 1−Bel/parenleftbig A/parenrightbig . Hence, we obtainBel(A)≤Pl(A), and the interval[ Bel(A),Pl(A) ]⊆[0,1]quanti- fiesthetotalandthemaximallyplausiblesupportforAgiventheavailableevidence.",

[5]): m(C) =1 1−K/summationdisplay A∩B=Cm1(A)m 2(B), K=/summationdisplay A∩B=∅m1(A)m 2(B), To computem(C), first sum the productsm 1(A)m 2(B)over all subsetsAandB whose intersection equalsC. Then, normalize this sum by dividing by1−K, where Kquantifies the total conflict betweenm 1andm 2as the mass assigned to disjoint subsets. 2.2 Dynamic ignorance and feature-specific BPA mapping To map damage-sensitive featuresD= (D 1,...,Dn)⊤into BPA that explicitly quantify uncertainty, we introduce a physics-grounded dynamic ignorance model combining four evidence cues. This approach addresses key limitations of static ignorance models in structural health monitoring [2, 23]. 2.2.1 Normalization and concentration metrics For each elementi(where each element is a section of the beam between uniformly distributed measurement points) with damage indexD i≥0, compute: Dnorm i =Di/summationtextn k=1Dk+ϵ(probability mass) Drel i=Di maxkDk+ϵ(relative severity) Here,ϵ= 10−10prevents division by zero. Using the probability mass, we can then quantify the damage concentration via normalized Shannon entropy [25]: H(D) =−1 lnnn/summationdisplay k=1Dnorm kln(Dnorm k +ϵ), conc= 1−H(D)(2) Here,conc≈1indicates localized damage (low uncertainty), whileconc≈0sug- gests distributed damage (high uncertainty). 2.2.2 Ranking and ignorance components The dynamic ignorance model decomposes uncertainty into four physically inter- pretable components by following established frameworks that distinguish between different types of ignorance and uncertainty in decision-making [26]. 1. Thedistribution uniformity di= 1−conc measures global damage dispersion uncertainty using information entropy for each elementi. High values (d i≈1) occur when damage is uniformly distributed (H(D)≈1), indicating low localization confidence. Low values 5 (di≈0) indicate concentrated damage with high confidence [25]. This aligns with the concept of complexity-based uncertainty where system properties emerge from multiple interacting elements [28]. 2. For each elementi, therelative weakness r′ i= 1−Drel i quantifies element-specific damage severity uncertainty using relative damage indices, approaches 1 for elements withD i≪max(D)(low relative dam- age), and approaches 0 for maximally damaged elements. This component reflects probability-based uncertainty where outcomes are indeterminate but estimable through relative comparisons [21]. 3. Therank-based uncertainty ki=ri n−1 withri∈{0,...,n−1}, where0denotes the highest damage, represents positional uncertainty in the damage hierarchy for each elementi. Thus, top- ranked elements havek i= 0and bottom-ranked elements havek i= 1. This addresses ambiguity-based uncertainty where information reliability varies across rankings [14]. 4. For each elementi, theconfidence-based uncertainty ci= 1−σi,whereσ i=1 1 + exp(−λ fDi) characterizes measurement reliability using the feature-specific sensitivityλ f by incorporating the psychological concept oftolerance for uncertainty[13]. This logistic mapping transforms damage indices into confidence scores, re- flecting how different features contribute to ignorance [9]. Each feature type f(frequency, strain, etc.) has an associated sensitivity parameterλ f>0. Higher values ofλ fproduce steeper confidence transitions, cf. Figure 1. As- signing a largerλ fto a particular featurefmeans expressing greater trust in that feature’s damage-index values—i.e., even a modest non-zeroD ifrom that feature is strong evidence",

As- signing a largerλ fto a particular featurefmeans expressing greater trust in that feature’s damage-index values—i.e., even a modest non-zeroD ifrom that feature is strong evidence of real damage. 2.2.3 Weighted ignorance synthesis The ignorance factorα icombines the four ignorance and uncertainty components through physics-informed weighting, i.e., αi=wddi+wrr′ i+wkki+wcci (3) with weightsw= (w d,wr,wk,wc)⊤∈(0,1)4related to the distribution uniformity di, the relative weaknessr′ i, the rank-based uncertaintyk i, and the feature con- fidenceci, respectively. The weights are constrained by/summationtextw= 1. More details about the weights and their physical significance are provided in Table 1. The ignorance factor is constrained toα i∈[α min,1]whereα min= 0.1, which ensures a minimum 10% uncertainty even for strong evidence. We setα min= 0.1 (a 10% ignorance floor) as a conservative lower bound on uncertainty to pre- vent the fusion process becoming over-confident when evidence is limited or when model/sensor errors and unmodelled effects are present [30]. 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10.60.81 Diσiλf=1 2 λf= 5 λf= 10Figure 1: Feature-specific logistic confidence curves.

The belief factorβ i= 1−αiscales the normalized damage index, i.e., mi({i}) =β i·Dnorm iand mi(Θ) =αi, where •Dnorm i:describes the normalized damage index for elementi, •βi:indicates the belief factor, quantifying the specific belief committed to elementi, and •αi:represents the ignorance factor, quantifying the uncommitted belief mass. 2.3 Modal strain-energy change ratio (MSECR) The modal strain-energy change ratio (MSECR) quantifies the relative change in strain-energy that is stored in each Finite Element between undamaged and dam- aged states [8]. In the Finite Element discretization the classical elastic strain en- ergy associated with a (static) displacement vectoruis1 2u⊤Ku. Here, we evaluate the corresponding modal contribution by inserting the modal displacements (eigen- vectors). Let{ϕund j}and{ϕdam j}be the mass-normalized eigenvectors (more de- tails in Section 3.1) of the undamaged and damaged beam, respectively, for modes j= 1,...,m. Denote the elemental stiffness matrix for elementibyK i. All el- emental stiffness matricesK iare assembled in the global degree-of-freedom basis and therefore share the same dimension as the global eigenvectorϕ. We first compute the total modal strain-energy in elementi: SEund i=m/summationdisplay j=1/parenleftbig ϕund j/parenrightbig⊤Kiϕund j, SEdam i=m/summationdisplay j=1/parenleftbig ϕdam j/parenrightbig⊤Kiϕdam j. The MSECR index is then defined as the absolute relative change: DSE i=/vextendsingle/vextendsingleSEund i−SEdam i/vextendsingle/vextendsingle Elements experiencing a local stiffness reduction (e.g., due to damage) exhibit a pronounced drop in modal strain-energy, makingDSE ia sensitive indicator of dam- age localization. As is clear from the formulation, the MSECR relies on both the experimental data as well as element stiffness matrices, which are retrieved from a FEM solver. 2.4 Flexibility-based damage",

As is clear from the formulation, the MSECR relies on both the experimental data as well as element stiffness matrices, which are retrieved from a FEM solver. 2.4 Flexibility-based damage index Following Grande and Imbimbo’s multi-stage damage detection framework [12], we construct an element-wise flexibility change index that directly measures how each element’s resistance to bending decreases due to damage. Let the global 8 flexibility (inverse of stiffness) matrices for the undamaged and damaged structures be obtained by modal superposition: Fund=m/summationdisplay j=11 /parenleftbig ωund j/parenrightbig2ϕund j/parenleftbig ϕund j/parenrightbig⊤,Fdam=m/summationdisplay j=11 /parenleftbig ωdam j/parenrightbig2ϕdam j/parenleftbig ϕdam j/parenrightbig⊤ For each elemente, we extract its local curvature-strain compliance via the projec- tion matricesL e(disassembly) andS e(curvature extraction): F(·) e=Se/parenleftig LeF(·)Le⊤/parenrightig Se⊤,(·)∈{und,dam} The element index then is the Frobenius norm of the compliance change, i.e., DF e=/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleFdam e−Fund e/vextenddouble/vextenddouble F, which quantifies the increase in curvature-per-unit-moment (i.e., curvature com- pliance) at elemente, corresponding to a local reduction in flexural rigidityEI (asκ/M= 1/(EI)). This flexibility-based measure has been shown to be highly sensitive to local stiffness reductions, making it an effective complement to modal- energy-based indices [12]. We have now briefly introduced Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. In the next section, we continue with damage localization using FEM. 3 FEM based model updating for damage local- ization In this section, we describe an approach of damage detection and localization based on optimization, in combination with a numerical (Finite Element) model. In Section 3.1 we first introduce the objective functional that is to be minimized. Section 3.2 introduces a gradient-based optimization approach, together with the required derivatives. In Section 3.3 we describe an additional hierarchical process that uses the optimization approach and iteratively locates damage in a more and more detailed manner. 3.1 Objective function Weformulatethedamage-localizationproblemasanoptimizationprobleminwhich the total objective functionJis the weighted sum of three error terms. The objec- tive function reads J(θ) =α fEf(θ) +αgEg(θ) +αcEc(θ),(4) whereθdenotes the vector of damage parameters andα (·)are the corresponding weights for each part of the objective function. The three contributions in (4) serve complementary roles in the objective: •Ef:Frequency shifts detect global stiffness changes, making this term sen- sitive to overall structural integrity. •Eg:The governing residual enforces model-experiment consistency, thereby acting as a physics-based objective. 9 •Ec:Curvature captures local bending anomalies, providing good spatial res- olution for damage localization. For the following descriptions, we consider a classical free vibration Euler- Bernoulli beam as in (1), i.e.,q(x,t) = 0. We use the common assumption that the system response (i.e., the time-dependent deflection of the beamw(x,t)) can be decomposed into a time- and a space-dependent part, i.e., w(x,t) =X(x)·T(t),whereT(t) = e−iωt. This yields the differential equation 0 =ρ(x)A(x)X(x)∂2T(t) ∂t2+∂2 ∂x2/parenleftbigg E(x)I(x)∂2X(x) ∂x2/parenrightbigg T(t) =ρ(x)A(x)X(x)(−iω)2e−iωt+∂2 ∂x2/parenleftbigg E(x)I(x)∂2X(x) ∂x2/parenrightbigg e−iωt =−ρ(x)A(x)X(x)ω2+∂2 ∂x2/parenleftbigg E(x)I(x)∂2X(x) ∂x2/parenrightbigg .(5) If we have constant material parametersE(x) =E=const.,I(x) =I=const., ρ(x) =ρ=const. andA(x) =A=const., then we immediately obtain 0 =−ρAω2X(x) +EI∂4X(x) ∂x4. Solving this ordinary differential equation forX(x)yields infinitely many solutions Xj(x),j= 1,2,..., which are given by Xj(x) =Acosh(β jx) +Bsinh(β jx) +Ccos(β jx)",

These boundary conditions prescribe the value ofX j(x) or its derivatives at some pointsx∈/bracketleftbig −L 2,L 2/bracketrightbig , whereLis the length of the beam. The natural frequenciesω jandβjare related to each other by βj=4/radicaligg ρAω2 j EI. Common descriptions of this problem also include the eigenvalueλ j, which simply is given byλ j=ω2 j. The beam vibration frequency can also easily be calculated asfj=ωj 2π. The corresponding functionX j(x)is called the mode and the shape of Xj(x), denoted asϕ j(x), is called the mode shape or eigenvector. However, non-constant material parameters, e.g., due to damage, require al- ternative methods to obtain frequencies and mode shapes. The Finite Element method is commonly used to obtain (a approximation of) these frequencies and mode shapes. This is the approach that we follow in this manuscript. Thus, our mode shapes and frequencies are obtained numerically and in a discrete sense. We use a uniform computational mesh with element sizeh. Only the firstmmodes are considered, as higher-frequency modes tend to be more difficult to measure in physical experiments due to higher structural damping, smaller amplitudes, and thus a stronger influence of noise on the measurements. As already described in Section 1, damage in the form of a crack is best modeled by a local change in the Young’s modulus. Thus, we identify the damage parametersθwith the Young’s modulusE(x). 10 Frequency-shift error.We measure relative shifts of the firstmeigenfrequen- cies between experiment and model. The experimental data, and therefore also the eigenfrequencies from the experiment, are independent of the choice of (numerical) damage parametersθ. The model eigenfrequency has a dependence onθ. Thus, we have Ef(θ) =m/summationdisplay j=1/parenleftigg ωexp j−ωmod j(θ) ωexp j/parenrightigg2 . Governing-equation residual.If the numerical model matches perfectly with the experiment, then all experimental mode shapesϕexp j(x)fulfill (5). Us- ing the Finite Element method yields a discretization, i.e., a discretized mode shapeϕmod j(x,θ)(a vector), a global mass matrixMmod(θ), and a global stiff- ness matrixKmod(θ). Then, for each modej, the ideal relation /parenleftbig ωexp j/parenrightbig2/parenleftbig ϕexp j/parenrightbig⊤Mmod(θ)ϕexp j=/parenleftbig ϕexp j/parenrightbig⊤Kmod(θ)ϕexp j should hold.

Letλmod jandϕmod jbe thejth eigenvalue and discretized eigenvector of the current model, as described in Section 3.1.

[10, Formulation 2]). As previously mentioned, we only use the Young’s modulus as an indication of damage and thus have∂Mmod(θ) ∂θk=0. The derivative of the local (element) stiffness matrix with respect to the Young’s modulus of elementiis easily calculated and is given by1 θk·Ki(θ)ifi=k, while the derivative with respect toθ kwithk̸=iis zero. Reassembling the global stiffness matrix from these evaluations then yields ∂Kmod(θ) ∂θi. These expressions are used to form the gradient∇J(θ), which the L- BFGS optimizer then employs to updateθiteratively until convergence.

There is no direct solution to this problem as it is not the limitation of the algo- rithm, but the very ill-posedness of the problem that stagnates the progress towards convergence to the true damage profile. However, there are ways to circumvent this problem by regularization or other means. In the context of FEM-based damage localization, a popular technique is the Tikhonov regularization [29] which has also been used in this study. Tikhonov regularization:To dampen oscillatory solutions and improve the stability of the inverse problem, a quadratic penalty on the damage vector is intro- duced, leading to the regularized objective function Jreg(θ) =J(θ) +γ∥θ∥2 2, whereγ >0is the regularization parameter. The choice ofγis critical and can be guided by the L-curve criterion [15], which seeks a balance between the solution norm∥θ∥ 2and the residual normJ(θ). While Tikhonov regularization improves well-posedness, selecting an appropri- ateγand achieving a physically plausible solution can still be challenging. This motivated the exploration of the alternative solution strategies presented in the following sections. 3.3 Hierarchical approach To address the aforementioned challenges, one of the strategies implemented is a coarse-to-fine refinement strategy. We initiate the optimization with a minimal, 13 Start Define clusters Run FEM on clusters Analyze clusters Cluster∆E i>tol? Cluster size = 1?

Upon identifying an optimal coarse damage pattern, we selectively refine regions flagged by the optimizer while freezing less sensitive clusters to their original (healthy) states. This process is sketched in Figure 2 This progressive refinement constrains the solution space and mitigates opti- mizer stagnation, as each stage operates within a reduced subspace. Crucially, early iterations capture global damage trends, enabling more robust and efficient convergence during subsequent local refinements. The decision of how and when the optimizer refines or freezes clusters is gov- erned by dynamic stage tolerances. Starting with the largest clusters, the process proceeds until stagnation occurs. The clusters are then evaluated based on their deviation from healthy values. The tolerance is defined as a specified percentage (e.g., 90%) of the maximum observed variation. Clusters exceeding this tolerance are activated (refined) and values less than that are deemed insignificant changes with no physical meaning and hence are reset to their healthy values. 4 Numerical results All simulations are performed on a beam (cf. Figure 3) with rectangular cross- section, which is 1000mm long, 20mm wide and 3.25mm thick. One-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is adopted.

By default, results correspond to the simply-supported beam unless otherwise specified. The beam was discretized into 20 elements (21 nodes), which is a relatively fine discretization compared to, e.g., [8]. 4.1 DS-based damage localization Initially, the following is evaluated as the potential sources of damage information: 1. Damage indices based on eigenfrequencies Damage alters stiffness and thus natural frequencies. For each elementi, we computetheweightedsumofabsolutefrequencyshifts∆ω j=/vextendsingle/vextendsingleωdam j−ωund j/vextendsingle/vextendsingle, using normalized stiffness matrix sensitivities to form weights., i.e., Df i=m/summationdisplay j=1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(ϕdam j)TKiϕdam j/vextendsingle/vextendsingle /summationtextne i=1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(ϕdam j)TKiϕdam j/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleωdam j−ωund j/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. 2. Damage indices based on modal curvature For each modejwe calculate the curvature residualsκund j−κdam j. Averaging squared residuals overmmodes gives a nodal root-mean-square (RMS)R n, 15 Figure 4: Overall comparison of the four damage measures wherenindexes nodal locations; this is projected to elementiby averaging its end-node values: Dκ i=1 2/parenleftbig Rni+Rni+1/parenrightbig , Rn=/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt1 mm/summationdisplay j=1/parenleftbig κund j(xn)−κdam j(xn)/parenrightbig2.

Damage indices based on strain energy Already described in detail in Section 2.3. 4. Damage indices based on flexibility Already described in detail in Section 2.4. Choosing the best features.As is clear from Figure 4, the flexibiliy- and strain-based measures (MSECR) are the most informative regarding damage lo- calization and hence they are adopted for the fusion using DS evidence theory (Figure 5a). Frequency- or curvature-based measures provide little to no useful information for that purpose and hence were not used further. 16 4.1.1 Impact of multiple damage sites on ignorance and fusion quality When more than one damage site is present, several interrelated effects degrade the precision of DS-based fusion. We summarize these below: i) Increased evidence dispersion.Withkdamage sites, the damage index vectorDbecomes more uniform: no singleD idominates. From (2), the normalized entropyH(D)approaches 1 as the number of comparable nonzero entries grows, so conc= 1−H(D)→0. A low concentration metric means thedistribution uniformitycomponentd i= 1−concrises towards 1 across the board, inflating the ignorance factorα ias in (3). ii) Higher rank ambiguity.Multiple similar-magnitude damage indices in- duce ties or near-ties in the ranking step. Recallk i=ri/(n−1)in Section 2.2.2. As more elements share close ranks, the average rank-based uncertainty ¯k=/summationtext iki/n increases, again inflatingα i. iii) Feature correlation and conflict.Strain and flexibility features re- spond differently to damage location and severity. With a single crack, their BPA tend to agree (low Dempster conflict). With multiple cracks, however, feature- specific BPA often allocate belief to different subsets ofΘ, yielding higher conflict mass Greaterconflitctforces more mass onto the ignorance during normalization, effectively reducing all singleton beliefsm({i}). iv) Dilution of feature confidence.Each feature’s logistic confidence curve saturates more slowly when multiple moderateD ivalues appear. Asσ i= (1 + exp(−λfDi))−1produces mid-range confidence for several elements, the comple- mentci= 1−σiremains non-negligible across manyi. Consequently, thefeature confidenceterm in (3) contributes more ignorance overall. All these factors manifest as “flatter” fused belief distributions and lower lo- calization peaks",
    "confidence curve saturates more slowly when multiple moderateD ivalues appear. Asσ i= (1 + exp(−λfDi))−1produces mid-range confidence for several elements, the comple- mentci= 1−σiremains non-negligible across manyi. Consequently, thefeature confidenceterm in (3) contributes more ignorance overall. All these factors manifest as “flatter” fused belief distributions and lower lo- calization peaks as the number of damage sites grows (cf. Figure 5). As can be observed when four locations are damaged, the fused belief mass for one healthy element is as high as for the damaged elements and hence can be misleading. 4.1.2 Effect of measurement noise Measurement noise—particularly in modal eigenvalues and eigenvectors—adversely affectsDS-theoreticfusionbyinflatinguncertaintyandconflict. Inourexperiments, we inject zero-mean Gaussian noise at levelsη∈{1%,2%,3%,5%}via ˜ωj=ωj(1 +ηN(0,1)), /tildewideϕj=ϕj+η|ϕj|N(0,1), whereωjandϕj(xi)are thejth eigenfrequency and the mode shape atx i, respec- tively. Whileη= 1%reflects a realistic noise floor (cf., e.g., [12]), we explore up to η= 5%to characterize degradation. 17 (a) Single damage location (b) Two damage locations (c) Three damage locations (d) Four damage locations Figure 5: Effect of multiple damage locations on fused beliefs 18 (a) 1% measurement noise (b) 2% measurement noise (c) 3% measurement noise (d) 5% measurement noise Figure 6: Effect of measurement noise on fused damage beliefs Noise corrupts the baseline modal features used to compute damage indicesD i. Random perturbations yield high-variance estimates ˆDi, broadening the distribu- tionDand the normalized entropyH(D)approaches 1. All four ignorance components (d i,r′ i,ki,ci) increase with noise, yieldingα iin (3) that approaches unity asηincreases. Consequently, belief factorsβ i= 1−αi shrink toward zero, and fused belief distributions flatten out. Our four-case plot series with noise ofη= 1,2,3,5%in Figure 6 clearly shows progressive deterioration: Atη= 1%, localization peaks remain discernible; at η= 5%, the damage signal is nearly indistinguishable from noise. This underscores the need for denoising or robust feature extraction when applying DS fusion in high-noise environments. 4.2 FEM based localization The objective function given by (4) in Section 3.1 consists of three terms. While the first two terms are more dependent on the global behaviour of the structure, the curvature (third term) is very sensitive to local changes in material parameters. As noted earlier, our inverse Finite Element method formulation minimizes the function using the L-BFGS algorithm. We now present two cases: (i) recovery of a uniform (undamaged) beam, and (ii) identification of localized stiffness reductions. 19 (a) Objective convergence (b) Initial guess (c) Intermediate distribution (d) Healthy state Figure 7: FEM based localization convergence to healthy state (i) Healthy beam: convergence to trueEvalues.Starting from a homogeneous initial guess of Young’s modulus (e.g.,E i= 10GPa for all elements), we run a gradient-based optimizer (L-BFGS) to minimizeJ(θ). In the absence of any damage, all elements have the same value of parameters, including their Young’s moduli. Thus, the first two terms in (4) are sufficient to determine the healthy state as they provide complete information on the global behaviour of the beam. This prevents unnecessary computation of an additional term (curvature) in the objective and therefore also its gradient. Figure 7 demonstrates that, in the absence of damage, the combined functional provides sufficient global gradient information to guide the",
    "state as they provide complete information on the global behaviour of the beam. This prevents unnecessary computation of an additional term (curvature) in the objective and therefore also its gradient. Figure 7 demonstrates that, in the absence of damage, the combined functional provides sufficient global gradient information to guide the search to the correct homogeneous solution. (ii) Damaged beam: ill-conditioning and local minima.To simulate damage, we reduce the true Young’s moduliEin elements 7 and 8 by 25% to Edamaged = 52.5GPa, while keeping the rest at healthy values. Using the healthy solution as initial guess1, the optimizer is now tasked with localizing the region of reduced stiffness. Hence all the terms of (4) are used, including the regularization to penalize unnecessary changes from the healthy state values. Figure 8 shows 1All subsequent simulations for damage localization are performed using healthy state as the initial guess. 20 (a) Objective convergence (b) Final damage profile Figure 8: FEM based convergence for 2 damaged elements (a) Objective convergence (b) Final damage profile Figure 9: FEM based convergence with 4 damaged elements the objective convergence and damage profile of the problem. The profile may not match the real values perfectly, but the damaged elements are clearly highlighted but also spread over the adjacent elements. Apart from that there are also small but misleading damages in elements 12 and 20, which of course have no actual damages. However, the solution may not always converge smoothly for every possible damage location or any boundary condition, as is clear in Figure 9. Although the curvature term of the objective is very sensitive to these local drops, we observe that the objectiveJcan stagnate in a higher-energy “false” minimum even after regularization. The results get worse as the damage gets more complex. This is illustrated by Figure 10, where damage is present at two separate locations. The results only provide very crude information about the damage profile. Like many other inverse problems, which are ill-conditioned, non-uniqueness and local minima are a big concern in this case as well. The difficulty in damage localization highlights the need for enhanced optimization strategies. 21 (a) Objective convergence (b) Final damage profile Figure 10: FEM based convergence with 2 separate damage locations 4.2.1 Hierarchical approach As explained in Section 3.3, we start with a coarse discretization and gradually refineit. Asalways, thebeamisdiscretizedwith20elementstokeepthecomparison consistent. Following notations are used:N gas the initial number of groups,G s as the initial group size. Also in the convergence plots, the label of the horizontal axis is changed to ’Evaluation number’ rather than ’Iteration’ to emphasize the fact that the optimizer is restarted at each stage. Case I:N g= 5,G s= 4and damage in one full group.This is the simplest case when 5 groups are chosen as design variables in the beginning and one whole group (one cluster) is damaged. Figure 11 shows objective convergence and progression toward the final dam- aged state. In Figure 11a, one can notice the jump in objective value due to stage transfer resulting in freezing of inactive clusters to their original healthy Young’s moduli values and",
    "and one whole group (one cluster) is damaged. Figure 11 shows objective convergence and progression toward the final dam- aged state. In Figure 11a, one can notice the jump in objective value due to stage transfer resulting in freezing of inactive clusters to their original healthy Young’s moduli values and division of active clusters. The freezing process often results in a temporary increment (but may also result in a decrement) of the objective value. Case II:N g= 5,G s= 4and damage in two sub-groups.The hier- archical approach is now tested for a more complex case, where it is not possible to locate the damage in the coarsely discretized state. Instead, the algorithm is required to go for further refinements. Additionally, two locations are damaged. The results for this case can bee seen in Figure 13 and it is clear that the process has stalled without yielding much information. This is caused by the significant domination and variation in the curvature term in the intermediate results, which prevents the algorithm from taking any further step. This problem has been delib- erately chosen to highlight that even the hierarchical approach is not a universal solution of any complex damage localization problem. AninterestingresultisachievedwhenthecurvaturetermE f(θ)in(4)isomitted for this case. One might notice a different scale in the objective (cf. Figure 12). This means that global terms can suffice for convergence when a low-dimensional subproblem instead of a full-dimensional optimization problem is solved. As stated earlier, especially in cases like these, the trust-region method outper- forms the L-BFGS algorithm without even modifying the original objective func- 22 (a) Objective convergence (b) Intermediate result (c) Final damaged profile Figure 11: Hierarchical approach for full cluster damage 23 (a) Objective convergence (b) Intermediate result 1 (c) Intermediate result 2 (d) Final damaged profile Figure 12: Hierarchical L-BFGS approach for sub-cluster damage omitting curvature error tion, see Figure 13. 4.3 Evidencefusion-basedcandidatefilteringandsubsequent FEM One last approach—and by far the most efficient in this study—is to combine Dempster–Shafer (DS) evidence fusion with a focused FEM update on a reduced parameter set. No additional user checks or manual freezing heuristics are required. The single plausibility parameterτ(taken as a percentage of the highest damage belief in this study), which decides the number of filtered candidates or elements to be passed to the FEM solver, suffices to control model complexity. Together, this hybrid DS–FEM framework leverages the strengths of both data- driven evidence fusion and physics-based inversion. It achieves high localization accuracy and reliable quantification with minimal user intervention and computa- tional overhead. To increase the reliability and account for measurement noise, the plausibility parameterτis taken as 70% in this study. In order to get a sense of comparison, the same problems discussed previously will now be solved using this method. Case I: One damage location: four damaged elements.This problem has already been solved before using simple FEM based model updation (cf.

Figure 8). Figure 16 shows the objective and damage profile for the same problem when solved with this coupled approach. We observe a very low objective value after only one iteration. A solution in accordance with the expected stiffness values is obtained after five iterations, which shows the quick and efficient progress towards detecting present damage. Case II: Two damage locations: two damaged elements at each locationFigure 17 shows the objective and damage profile using the coupled DS-FEM approach. The results using simple FEM and the hierarchical approach, have been shown in Figure 10 and Figure 13, respectively. Again, we observe that a stiffness distribution in accordance with the expected stiffness values is obtained using only five iterations. This shows the superiority of this combined method over the previous methods, which struggle to obtain the correct stiffness distribution. 5 Conclusions and outlook This study has presented a comprehensive investigation into data- and model- based approaches for structural damage localization and quantification, using a one-dimensional beam as a prototype. The results have demonstrated that while the FEM based model updation methodology is powerful, its straightforward ap- plication has been hindered by the inherent ill-conditioning of the inverse problem, which often could not be fully resolved by simple regularization techniques. To overcome this, two novel strategies have been developed: a hierarchical refinement 26 (a) Objective convergence (b) Final damage profile Figure 16: Coupled DS-FEM convergence for case I (a) Objective convergence (b) Final damage profile Figure 17: Coupled DS-FEM convergence for case II 27 approach and a hybrid technique coupling Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory- based data fusion with FEM. The hierarchical approach has shown significant improvement over baseline FEM, although its limitations under certain conditions have been identified and documented. In contrast, the hybrid DS-FEM fusion approach has proven supe- rior, achieving the fastest convergence and the most accurate damage profiles. Subsequent research will involve experimental validation using data from a physical structure to test the framework’s performance on real-world damage sce- narios.
