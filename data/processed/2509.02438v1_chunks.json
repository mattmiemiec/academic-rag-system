In this study, we investiga te the eﬀects of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure (both compressive and tensile) on the structural a nd electronic properties of 3 C-SiC. Our analysis is based on atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simu lations using an eﬃcient tight-binding Hamiltonian, whose accuracy is validated against density f unctional theory calculations. Moreover, to account for nuclear quantum eﬀects, we employ path-integ ral MD simulations. Our results show signiﬁcant changes in the direct electronic gap as a functio n of temperature and pressure, with a renormalization of about 80 meV due to zero-point motion. Un der hydrostatic tensile pressure, the direct band gap EΓvanishes at the material’s mechanical stability limit (spi nodal point, where the bulk modulus B→0). For uniaxial pressure, we observe instabilities (Young ’s modulus Y→0) at approximately 90 GPa for both tension and compression, wher eEΓ→0. Additionally, we analyze the pressure dependence of the internal energy, lattice par ameter, and bond length, along with their ﬁnite-temperature ﬂuctuations, which exhibit anomalies n ear the instability points. I. INTRODUCTION Silicon carbide is a versatile material renowned for its outstanding properties. It exhibits high hardness and excellent thermal conductivity, making it useful for elec- tronic and power device applications. Additionally, SiC’s electrical conductivity enhances its suitability for semi- conductor technologies, particularly in high-temperature and high-power electronics [1, 2]. With a high melting point and remarkable mechanical strength at elevated temperatures, it also plays an important role in indus- tries such as aerospace and automotive [3, 4]. The cubic 3 C-SiC phase is one of the most well-known forms of silicon carbide, stable under ambient condi- tions. Its mechanical properties have been extensively studied over the years through both theoretical [5–10] and experimental methods [11–15], owing to their sig- niﬁcance in both fundamental research and technological applications. In addition, the behavior of semiconduct- ing materials, particularly silicon carbide, under high- pressure conditions has recently attracted increasing in- terest. This is largely due to the potential role of such materials in the extreme environments of carbon-rich ex- oplanets,wherehigh-pressureconditionscansigniﬁcantly alter their physical properties [12, 15]. Studyingthebehaviorofmaterialsunderextremepres- sure conditions involves not only large compressive pres- sure but also tensile stress (negative pressure). This as- pect is particularly relevant for investigating unexplored metastability regions of solids [16–20]. In recent years, the experimentally accessible range of hydrostatic (or quasi-hydrostatic) tensile pressure has expanded, accom- panied by a growing understanding of material proper- ties in environmentsthat arechallengingto controlin the laboratory [20–23].Experimental studies of solids at negative pressure are relatively uncommon due to the metastable nature of these conditions, which are",
    "recent years, the experimentally accessible range of hydrostatic (or quasi-hydrostatic) tensile pressure has expanded, accom- panied by a growing understanding of material proper- ties in environmentsthat arechallengingto controlin the laboratory [20–23].Experimental studies of solids at negative pressure are relatively uncommon due to the metastable nature of these conditions, which are typically achievable only for brief duration. Notably, carbon-based materials have been investigated under tensile stress using ultrasonic cavitationand shockwavesgeneratedby picosecondlaser pulses [24, 25]. Additionally, low-density clathrates of C, Si, and Ge, metastable at ambient pressure, have been successfully synthesized [26, 27]. In this con- text, silicon has been explored under negative pressure through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enabling the study of cavitation and crystal-liquid interfaces un- der such conditions [28, 29]. These simulations also re- vealed a transition to a clathrate phase at approximately P≈ −2.5 GPa [30]. Various computational methods have been employed for research on 3 C-SiC, especially those based on den- sity functional theory (DFT) at T= 0 [6, 9, 31–33]. To account for ﬁnite-temperature properties, including anharmonic eﬀects, classical atomistic simulations such as MD have been performed by several research groups [8, 30, 34–36]. Taking into account that the Debye tem- perature Θ Dof 3C-SiC is clearly higher than room tem- perature (Θ D≈1100 K [37]), the combination of quan- tum nuclear motion (or phonon quantization) and anhar- monicity of lattice vibrations may aﬀect the material’s properties up to relatively high temperatures. Limitations associated with classical MD simulations may be overcome by computational techniques that ex- plicitly account for nuclear quantum motion, such as Feynman path integrals. These methods have recently gainedimportance in investigatingvariousphysicalprop- erties of materials, including diamond [38, 39], silicon [40], boron nitride [41, 42], and graphene [43, 44]. Nu- clear quantum eﬀects have been found to signiﬁcantlyarXiv:2509.02438v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 2 Sep 2025 2 inﬂuence electronic band gaps [45] and the isotopic de- pendence of the lattice parameter in 3 C-SiC [46]. The electron-phonon interaction in tetrahedral semi- conductors has traditionally been studied from a the- oretical perspective using perturbation theory [47, 48]. An alternative approach to investigate the coupling be- tween vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom in solids involves simultaneously applying a path-integral description for nuclear dynamics along with an elec- tronic structure method, such as the tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian employed here. This allows both atomic nuclei and electrons in the solid to be treated as quan- tum particles within the Born-Oppenheimer approxima- tion, thereby directly incorporating phonon-phonon and electron-phonon interactions into the atomistic simula- tion. In this paper, we analyze the metastability zone of cu- bic SiC for hydrostatic pressure P <0 (tension), as well as the eﬀects of tensile and compressive uniaxial pressure on its structural and electronic properties. We present outcomes of MD simulations performed with an inter- atomic potential based on an eﬃcient TB Hamiltonian. The reliability of results under far-from-equilibrium con- ditions is evaluated by comparison with DFT calcula- tions carried out at T= 0.

We assess nuclear quantum eﬀects by comparing outcomes of path-integral molecu- lar dynamics (PIMD) simulations with those yielded by classical MD using the same TB model. Our results in- dicate that quantum corrections manifest themselves in the structural and electronic properties of 3 C-SiC, being observable even at temperatures higher than 300 K. The present workmakestwo keycontributions: ﬁrst, it extends previous studies on cubic SiC under hydrostatic pressure to include uniaxial pressure; second, it exam- ines the eﬀects of both hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure (tension and compression) on the electronic structure of this material, with a particular focus on changes induced in the direct band gap at the Γ point. Special emphasis is given to the limits of mechanical stability of the ma- terial under tension and compression, where the direct band gap EΓvanishes. The paper is organized as follows: Sec. II outlines the computational methods employed, including molec- ular dynamics simulations (II.A), the tight-binding ap- proach(II.B), andtheDFT method (II.C). In Sec.III, we present the results and discussion for the energy (III.A), crystal structure (III.B), bond length (III.C), elastic con- stants (III.D), and electronic gap (III.E). The main ﬁnd- ings are summarized in Sec. IV. II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD A. Molecular dynamics We investigate the structural, elastic, and electronic properties of 3 C-SiC using two types of MD simula- tions, enabling us to determine the equilibrium statesof the system under various pressure and temperature conditions. First, we employ classical MD simulations, where Newton’s equations of motion are solved numeri- cally to trace atomic trajectories over time. Second, we use PIMD simulations, which explicitly account for the quantum nature of atomic nuclei at ﬁnite temperatures. The primary computational distinction between the two approaches lies in the representation of atomic nuclei: in PIMD each nucleus is modeled as a set of NTr(Trotter number) beads, mimicking classical particles arranged in a ring polymer [49–52]. This creates a pseudoclassical system that accurately reproduces quantum properties. Comparing results from classical MD and PIMD simula- tionsallowsus toevaluatethe impactofnuclearquantum eﬀects on various properties. Notably, the classical limit is achieved in this formulation by setting NTr= 1, where the ring polymers collapse into single particles. Our simulations were conducted in the isothermal- isobaric ( NPT) ensemble, utilizing an interatomic po- tential derived from a TB Hamiltonian, as described in Sec.II.B.Thesimulationalgorithmswerebasedonestab- lished methods from the literature [53, 54]. For PIMD simulations, staging coordinates were used to describe the bead positions within the ring polymers, and each staging coordinate was coupled to a chain of four Nos´ e- Hoover thermostats to maintain a constant temperature. Similarly, a chainof fourthermostats wasattached to the barostat, allowing for the necessary volume ﬂuctuations to achieve the target pressure [52, 55]. The equations of motion were integrated using the reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA), which enables the use of diﬀerent time steps for integrating fast and slow degrees of freedom [56].

The equations of motion were integrated using the reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA), which enables the use of diﬀerent time steps for integrating fast and slow degrees of freedom [56]. For fast dynamical variables, such as bead interactions and thermostats, a time step of δt= 0.25 fs was used, while a larger time step of ∆ t= 1 fs was employed for the slower dynamics associated with interatomic forces. Additional details on this type ofsimulation can be found in [44, 55]. Most of our simulations, including both classical and PIMD, were performed on 2 ×2×2 supercells of the face- centered cubic unit cell of 3 C-SiC (N= 64 atoms) with periodic boundary conditions. To verify the convergence of the results, additional simulations were conducted us- ing 3×3×3 supercells (216 atoms). Energy convergence was further assessed at T= 300 K for even larger cells, up toN= 384 atoms (see below). The conﬁguration space was sampled across a temper- ature range of 50 to 1500 K. Some classical simulations were carried out at T= 10 K to study the stability limit underpressurewithoutthelargervolumeﬂuctuationsap- pearingathigher T. We consideredhydrostaticpressures from−44 GPa (tension) to 60 GPa (compression), as well as uniaxial pressure Pxapplied along the [100] crys- tal axis, varying between −84 and 90 GPa. For both classical and quantum simulations, 2 ×105steps were used for system equilibration, followed by 8 ×106steps tocomputeaverageproperties. InPIMDsimulations, the Trotter number NTrwas temperature-dependent, follow- 3 ing the relation NTrT= 6000 K. This ensured a nearly constant accuracy across the temperature range [44]. In the following, we will call PandPxthe hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure, respectively. In the notation of elasticity, we have σxx=σyy=σzz=−Pin the ﬁrst case, and σxx=−Pxin the second, where {σij}is the stress tensor. B. Tight-binding method To deﬁne the Born-Oppenheimer surface for nuclear motion in both classical and PIMD simulations, we have employed an eﬀective tight-binding Hamiltonian [57]. In principle, it could be possible to use ab initio meth- ods (e.g., DFT) for ﬁnite-temperature PIMD simula- tions, but in practice this procedure would considerably reduce the extent of simulation trajectories and/or the simulation-cell size. In the present calculations, we use a method that considers the quantum character of the electrons (TB Hamiltonian) for MD simulations (classical atomic nu- clei), complemented with a procedure to take into ac- count the quantum nature of atomic nuclei in PIMD sim- ulations,asdescribedaboveinSec.II.A.ThisTBmethod usesanon-orthogonalHamiltoniandevelopedbyPorezag et al.[57], based on DFT calculations in the local den- sity approximation (LDA). Speciﬁcally, the TB formal- ism used in our MD simulations was adapted from the package TROCADERO [58]. The actual parameteriza- tion for structures including C and Si atoms was given in Ref. [59]. Atomic orbitals are deﬁned as eigenfunctions ofproperlybuilt pseudoatoms, with overlapmatrices and Hamiltonian matrix elements tabulated as functions of the internuclear distance. The non-orthogonality of the atomic basis provides a transferable TB parametrization to complex systems [57]. This TB parameterization has been employed to study bulk silicon carbide [60, 61], isotopic and quantum eﬀects in 3C-SiC [46, 62], along with its surface reconstructions [59]. In recent years, it",

This TB parameterization has been employed to study bulk silicon carbide [60, 61], isotopic and quantum eﬀects in 3C-SiC [46, 62], along with its surface reconstructions [59]. In recent years, it was applied to analyze several as- pects of newly synthesized SiC monolayers [63, 64]. The eﬃciency of TB methods to describe a collection of prop- erties in condensed matter and molecular systems was reviewed by Goringe et al.[65]. In our classical MD simulations, atomic motion is gov- erned by Newton’s equations, with both total energy and interatomic forces derived from the TB Hamilto- nian. This approach enables tracking of the material’s evolving electronic structure throughout the simulation. A similar methodology is applied in PIMD simulations, where interatomic forces are also computed using the TB Hamiltonian. In this context, the electronic structure is obtained by averaging over imaginary time, speciﬁcally across the NTrtime slices (beads). In this work, the electronic degreesof freedom in recip- rocal space have been sampled by considering only the Γ point (k= 0).

Lines are guides to the eye. points results in a minor change in the total energy, with no signiﬁcant impact on the energy diﬀerences that are crucial to our analysis. Although the minimum-energy E0(the classical limit for T= 0) exhibits a slight shift, this shift diminishes as the simulation cell is enlarged. In Fig. 1 we present the energy E−E0of unstressed 3C-SiC (P= 0) derived from our simulations at T= 300 K. Solid circles and open squares represent results of classical MD and PIMD simulations, respectively. In both classical and quantum cases, E−E0convergesto 78 and 130 meV/atom, respectively. For N >50, the shift inE−E0due to the system size isless than 1 meV/atom. C. DFT calculations We evaluated the precision of the considered tight- binding method for predicting the structural and elec- tronic properties of 3 C-SiC by comparing its results with DFT calculations for this material at T= 0. To achieve this, electronic structure calculations were performed us- ing the Quantum ESPRESSO code [66, 67]. We utilized the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange- correlation functional optimized for solid-state systems (PBEsol)[68], incombinationwithprojector-augmented- wave (PAW) pseudopotentials for Si and C atoms [69]. For the plane-wave basis set, we employed cutoﬀ values of400 Ry for the chargedensity and 45 Ry for the kinetic energy. The calculations were performed on a cubic unit cell of SiC containing eight atoms, with periodic bound- ary conditions. Reciprocal space integration was carried out using a 10 ×10×10 Monkhorst-Pack grid [70].

This kind of cal- culations have signiﬁcantly contributed to advancing the understanding of the silicon carbide phase diagram, par- ticularly with respect to high-pressure phase transitions [6, 9, 31, 32]. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Energy In this section, we examine the energy of 3 C-SiC, derived from classical MD and PIMD simulations per- formed in the NPTensemble across a range of pressures and temperatures. At a given external pressure P, the energy at T= 0 can be expressed as E=E0 cl+EZP, whereE0 clrepresents the classical energy of static atoms, andEZPdenotes the zero-point energy. Both quantities are normalized as energy per atom. We begin by analyzing the dependence of the classical energy,Ecl−E0, on tensile hydrostatic pressure ( P <0), asshowninFig.2. Thesolidanddashed-dottedlinesrep- resent the DFT and TB results at T= 0, respectively. Our analysis shows that the TB curve closely tracks the DFT calculations up to a pressure of approximately −35 GPa. Beyond this point, the DFT data exhibit a noticeable increase, eventually leading to a mechanical instability in the crystal structure at Ps=−39(1) GPa. At this point, the pressure derivative of the energy di- verges,∂E/∂P → −∞. Similarly, for the TB results atT= 0, we observe a divergence at Ps=−44 GPa. In both cases, the spinodal pressure, Ps, is marked by a vertical arrow in Fig. 2.ForP >0, the energy increases with rising compres- sion, exhibiting no anomalies within the range where cu- bic SiC remains the stable phase ( P≤60 GPa). This behavior has been well-documented in several previous studies [6, 9, 31, 32, 62], and thus will not be elaborated upon here. In a quantum framework, the zero-point energy per atom,EZP, can be calculated in a harmonic approxima- tion from the vibrational density of states (VDOS), ρ(ω), as: EZP=1 2/integraldisplayωm 0/planckover2pi1ω 2ρ(ω)dω , (1) whereωmrepresents the maximum frequency in the phonon spectrum. The prefactor 1 /2 in Eq. (1) ensures the energy is calculated per atom, as ρ(ω) is normalized to account for the six degrees of freedom (corresponding to one Si and one C atom) in a crystallographic unit cell: /integraldisplayωm 0ρ(ω)dω= 6.

(1) ensures the energy is calculated per atom, as ρ(ω) is normalized to account for the six degrees of freedom (corresponding to one Si and one C atom) in a crystallographic unit cell: /integraldisplayωm 0ρ(ω)dω= 6. (2) The mean vibrational frequency, ω, is deﬁned as: ω=1 6/integraldisplayωm 0ωρ(ω)dω , (3) which gives: EZP= 3/planckover2pi1ω/2. The VDOS of 3 C-SiC for the present TB model was calculated and reported in Ref. [62]. For the unstressed material ( P= 0), it yields a zero-point energy of EZP= 115 meV/atom. By extrapolating the energy Eobtained from our PIMD simulations to T= 0, we determine EZP values of 108, 112, and 119 meV/atom for silicon car- bide under hydrostatic pressures of P=−30, 0, and 60 GPa, respectively. These values correspond to mean frequencies of ω= 581, 602, and 640 cm−1, respectively, following the expected trend under tensile and compres- sive pressure (see Table I). At T= 0, the quantum en- ergyEqlies between the classical and quantum results at T= 300 K shown in Fig. 2 and is omitted from the ﬁg- ureforclarity. Notably,theaveragefrequency ωobtained from PIMD simulations for P= 0 is 3 meV lower than that derived from the VDOS in the harmonicapproxima- tion. This shift in the zero-point energy (approximately 3%) arises primarily as an eﬀect of anharmonicity in the kineticenergyat T= 0,asdemonstratedbyperturbation theory calculations [62]. Turning to the results of our simulations at ﬁnite temperatures, Fig. 2 shows the energy at T= 300 K, with solid circles representing classical MD results and open squares denoting PIMD data. At low pressures (|P|/lessorsimilar5 GPa), the classical results exhibit a nearly con- stant increase of 3 kBT(78 meV/atom) compared to the data atT= 0, consistent with predictions from a har- monic model of lattice vibrations. As tensile pressure increases, the diﬀerence between the classical energies at T= 300 K and T= 0 grows, reaching 100 meV/atom atP=−30 GPa. This behavior suggests the emergence 5 TABLE I.

Examining the results of the PIMD simulations, we observe that for P= 0, the energy shows an increase of 52 meV/atom relative to the classical energy, yield- ing a total of 129 meV/atom at 300 K. Notably, this energy increase due to quantum nuclear motion varies from 40 meV/atom under tensile pressure of −30 GPa to 58 meV/atom under compressive pressure of 60 GPa (see Table I).

Notably, this energy increase due to quantum nuclear motion varies from 40 meV/atom under tensile pressure of −30 GPa to 58 meV/atom under compressive pressure of 60 GPa (see Table I). At 300 K, both the classical and quantum results exhibit a divergence in the slope of the energy- pressure curve for P≈ −43 GPa. As temperature increases, the results of classical MD and PIMD simulations converge, as nuclear quantum ef- fects diminish in signiﬁcance. For example, at T= 1000 K and P= 0, the diﬀerence between the two datasets is 17 meV/atom. This diﬀerence decreases fur- therto12meV/atomunderatensilepressureof −30GPa (see Table I). As the mean vibrational frequency ωin- creases with rising P, the derivative ∂EZP/∂Pis pos- itive. This results in a rise of the energy diﬀerence ∆E=Eq−Eclwith increasing P, which is most pro- nounced at low temperatures. The zero-point energy EZPderived from our PIMD simulations can be connected to the mean frequency ω, as indicated above, which in turn is related to the Debye frequency ωD=kBΘD//planckover2pi1, yielding (see Appendix A): ωD=8 9EZP /planckover2pi1=4 3ω . (4) ForP= 0, the zero-point energy obtained from our PIMD simulations gives a Debye temperature Θ D= 1155 K, near values presented in the literature for 3 C- SiC: 1123K derivedfrom speciﬁc heat measurements[37] and1147Kobtainedfrom ab initio calculationscombined with a quasi-harmonic approach [75]. B. Pressure eﬀects on the crystal structure For unstressed 3 C-SiC, the lattice parameter corre- sponding to the minimum-energy conﬁguration calcu- lated using the TB Hamiltonian is a0= 4.348˚A, yield-ing a crystal volume of V0= 10.277˚A3/atom. Similarly, our DFT calculations provide a0= 4.358˚A, which cor- responds to a volume of V0= 10.346˚A3/atom, consis- tent with previous ab initio results [9]. From the out- come of TB-PIMD simulations at P= 0, we obtain a low-temperature extrapolated lattice parameter value ofamin= 4.359˚A. This indicates a zero-point expan- sion arising from quantum nuclear motion, quantiﬁed as δa= 1.1×10−2˚A [62]. Furthermore, the lattice param- eteraderived from our ﬁnite-temperature PIMD simu- lations is in good agreement with values determined for 3C-SiC via x-ray diﬀraction experiments: a= 4.36˚A at 297 K and atmospheric pressure [45, 76]. 1. Hydrostatic pressure We now examine the eﬀect of hydrostatic pressure P on the crystal volume. Fig. 3 illustrates the pressure de- pendence ofthe lattice parameter aatT= 0, asobtained from TB calculations (dashed-dotted line) and DFT cal- culations (solid curve). The two curves exhibit strong agreement across a wide range of pressures, encompass- ing both tensile and compressive stress, as shown in the ﬁgure. Notably, the slope of both curves increases as the tensile stress is raised. For P <0, the lattice parameter approaches a mechanical instability under the same ten- sile stresses indicated in Fig. 2 for the energy at T= 0 (marked by vertical arrows). Fig. 3 also includes results from classical MD simu- lations conducted at high temperature ( T= 1500 K, shown as solid symbols). These results reveal a signif- icant lattice expansion under tensile stress, with a value ofδa= 8.4×10−2˚A atP=−30 GPa relative to the zero-temperature result. In contrast, under compression",

These results reveal a signif- icant lattice expansion under tensile stress, with a value ofδa= 8.4×10−2˚A atP=−30 GPa relative to the zero-temperature result. In contrast, under compression (P >0), the lattice expansion is considerably smaller. For instance, at P= 50 GPa, the lattice expansion is reduced to δa= 9×10−3˚A.

This condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the bulk modulus, B= −V∂P/∂V , asP=−∂F/∂V.

(7), yields Ps=−44(1) and −38(1) GPa for TB and DFT data at T= 0, respectively, in agreementwith earlierestimations [10]. Note the shift of Psfor the TB data at 1500 K, which turns out to be close to the DFT result at T= 0. At this point, we clarify that our use of the term “spin- odal” does not refer to phase separation in the classi- cal thermodynamic sense (such as in a binary mixture), driven by composition ﬂuctuations. Instead, it denotes the mechanical stability limit associated with the loss of convexity of the free energy with respect to strain or volume. Within this context, the spinodal corresponds to the point at which the elastic moduli, or the relevant componentsofthe stiﬀness tensor (in particular, the bulk modulus B) vanish, signaling the onset of mechanical in- stability. Our study thus focuses speciﬁcally on this second type of instability, which involves variations in speciﬁc volume(orequivalently, latticestrain)underpressure. Wedonot suggest the existence of a second thermodynamic phase as implied by classical spinodal decomposition. Rather, we identify a mechanical instability that can lead to structural transformations, amorphization, or fracture, depending on the deformation pathway and kinetic con- ditions. Put diﬀerently, at the spinodal point, the crystal lat- tice can no longer sustain uniform tension and becomes unstable with respect to inﬁnitesimal strain ﬂuctuations. During our atomistic simulations near the spinodal pres- surePs, we observe large volume ﬂuctuations that may precipitate the breakdown of the crystal structure.

During our atomistic simulations near the spinodal pres- surePs, we observe large volume ﬂuctuations that may precipitate the breakdown of the crystal structure. This breakdown is characterized by the sudden emergence of point and extended defects, potentially leading to frac- ture of the material. 2. Uniaxial pressure We now turn to the eﬀects of uniaxial pressure Pxon the structural properties. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the de- pendence of the lattice parameters ax(parallel to the applied pressure) and a⊥(⊥=y,z, perpendicular to the applied pressure) on Px. Open circles represent data for ax, while solid squares correspond to a⊥. These results were obtained from classical MD simulations. For sim- plicity, data derived from PIMD at 300 K are not shown, as they closelyalign with the classical results on the scale of the ﬁgure. The parameter axsatisﬁes∂ax/∂Px<0, with the slope steepening signiﬁcantly under both ten- sile (Px≈ −80 GPa) and compressive ( Px≈80 GPa) pressure. This behavior suggests the emergence of me- chanical instabilities in 3 C-SiC under extreme uniaxial pressures, as further discussed below. The Young’s modulus, Y, is a mechanical property that quantiﬁes a material’s resistance to tensile or com- pressivedeformationwhensubjectedtoanapplieduniax- ialpressure(in thiscase, Px). Inthelinearelasticregime, it is deﬁned as the ratio between the stress σxx=−Px and the resulting axial strain ǫxx= ∆ax/ax. Beyond the linearregion, foruniaxialpressureapplied alongthe [100] crystal axis, Ycan be expressed as: Y=−ax∂Px ∂ax=−∂Px ∂lnax. (8) From our results at T= 300 K, we ﬁnd a Young’s mod- ulus ofY= 369 GPa for Px= 0, which coincides with the value derived from stiﬀness elastic constants C11and C12[10] through the expression [79]: Y=(C11+2C12)(C11−C12) C11+C12. (9) This result is in good agreement with the data reported in Ref. [6].

This behavior indicates the onset of mechanical instabil- ities under these stress conditions. By extrapolating the MD results, we estimate the instability pressures to be Pi1 x=−84(2) GPa for tension and Pi2 x= 90(2) GPa for compression. For the parameter a⊥, we ﬁnd ∂a⊥/∂Px>0, con- sistent with a positive Poisson’s ratio, ν, for this solid [6, 62]. This ratio can be calculated as ν=−∆a⊥/∆ax for small values of Px. From our calculations, we ob- tainν= 0.23, which agrees well with the value derived from the elastic constants of cubic SiC [62].",
    "we ﬁnd ∂a⊥/∂Px>0, con- sistent with a positive Poisson’s ratio, ν, for this solid [6, 62]. This ratio can be calculated as ν=−∆a⊥/∆ax for small values of Px. From our calculations, we ob- tainν= 0.23, which agrees well with the value derived from the elastic constants of cubic SiC [62]. The deriva- tive∂a⊥/∂Pxdecreases under tensile pressures, and the Px–a⊥curve becomes nearly ﬂat for large |Px|. Conse- quently, ∂a⊥/∂Px→0, and the eﬀective Poisson’s ratio approaches zero near the instability at Pi1 x.Additional insights into the behavior of the solid near the instability points can be gained by analyzing the ﬂuctuations of the lattice parameters during simulation runs. These results are presented in Fig. 4(b), where the mean-squareﬂuctuations(MSFs) (∆ ax)2and(∆a⊥)2are shown as open circles and closed squares, respectively. The data were obtained from our classical MD simula- tions at 300 K. A sharp increase in (∆ ax)2is observed near the instability points, both under tensile and com- pressive uniaxial pressure. While the increase is less pro- nounced for (∆ a⊥)2, it remains noticeable in these re- gions. The results shown in Fig. 4(b) correspond to classi- cal MD simulations. For PIMD, we ﬁnd that the MSFs (∆ax)2and (∆a⊥)2are comparable to those presented in the ﬁgure. However, this similarity does not extend to the ﬂuctuations of the interatomic distances, which exhibit distinct behavior, as discussed below. C. Bond length For the minimum-energy state of 3 C-SiC, the TB Hamiltonianpredictsabonddistanceof d0 Si−C= 1.883˚A, which closely agrees with the DFT result of 1.887 ˚A. When accounting for zero-point nuclear motion, we ob- tain an adjusted bond distance of d0 Si−C= 1.888˚A, de- rived by extrapolating ﬁnite-temperature TB-PIMD re- sults toT= 0. Classicalsimulationsatﬁnite temperature Tshowthat the bond distance dSi−Cexhibits a linear dependence up toT≈1000 K, following dSi−C=d0 Si−C+b1Twith b1= 1.6×10−5˚A/K. This thermal expansion of the bond length is ampliﬁed under tensile pressure: at P= −30 GPa, the slope increases to b1= 4.4×10−5˚A/K, nearly three times its value at P= 0. Conversely, under compression, the slope decreases; for P= 60 GPa, we obtainb1= 5.2×10−6˚A/K, approximately half of the unstressed value. At low temperatures, the thermal ex- pansion of the real solid deviates from this linear trend, as∂dSi−C/∂T→0 forT→0, in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics. This eﬀect is conﬁrmed by PIMD simulations [45, 62], which account for zero- point expansion of both the atomic bond and the crystal lattice, as discussed earlier. At a given temperature (e.g., T= 300 K), the Si–C bond length under hydrostatic pressure follows a similar trend to the lattice parameter (see Fig. 3), in the whole region where the solid is mechanically stable. In particu- lar, under tensile stress, dSi−Cincreases rapidly near the spinodal pressure Ps. In contrast, under compression, no signiﬁcant anomalies are observed, with dSi−Cdecreasing smoothly across the stability range of the 3 C-SiC phase, as expected. At P= 0, the pressure derivative of the bond length is ∂dSi−C/∂P=−2.7×10−3˚A/GPa. The dependence of the bond length, dSi−C, on uniaxial pressure Pxis inﬂuenced by the crystal structure of 3 C- SiC, in which all Si–C bonds form the same angle, ϕ= 8 -100",

However, the response of dSi−Cto uniaxial pressure diﬀers signiﬁcantly from its behavior under hydrostatic pressure. This distinction is illustrated in Fig. 5(a), which shows the mean Si–C bond length as a function of Pxat a temperature of 300 K. Symbols represent the results from classical MD (solid circles) and PIMD simulations (open squares), with the quantum results lying slightly above the classical ones on the scale of the ﬁgure. The slope of the Px–dSi−Ccurve increases for grow- ing tensile stress, eventually diverging to −∞at the in- stability point Pi1 x=−84 GPa. At zero pressure, the derivative is ∂dSi−C/∂Px=−9.2×10−4˚A/GPa, which is one-third of ∂dSi−C/∂Pfor hydrostaticpressure, as ex- pected for uniaxial pressure in three-dimensional space.Under compression, the Si–C bond length reaches a min- imum at Px≈50 GPa. For higher Px,dSi−Cincreases until the material undergoes mechanical instability at a compressive pressure of Pi2 x≈90 GPa. Fig. 5(b) presents the MSF (∆ dSi−C)2obtained from classical (open circles) and quantum (open squares) sim- ulationsat300K.Forthe unstressedsolid, the MSF from PIMD is 1.9 times larger than that from classical simu- lations. This ratio remains nearly constant for Px>0 but decreases under tensile pressure, reaching approxi- mately 1.2 near the instability point at Pi1 x=−84 GPa. In both classical and quantum cases, the MSF exhibits a minimum at Px≈30 GPa, and increases rapidly as the instability pressure is approached under both tension and compression. This increase is more pronounced un- der tensile pressure, mirroring the behavior of the bond lengthdSi−Cshown in Fig. 5(a). D. Elastic constants In the context of the mechanical stability of cubic sil- icon carbide, it is important to emphasize that its elas- tic constantsundergosigniﬁcantmodiﬁcations within the pressure range considered in this study. Within the framework of the atomistic simulations presented here, these constants can be determined at ﬁnite temperatures by analyzing the strain response of the crystal to various applied stress conditions (i.e., diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the stress tensor). Accordingly, we have computed the elastic stiﬀness constants of 3 C-SiC from MD simula- tions, following the methodology detailed in Ref.",
    "here, these constants can be determined at ﬁnite temperatures by analyzing the strain response of the crystal to various applied stress conditions (i.e., diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the stress tensor). Accordingly, we have computed the elastic stiﬀness constants of 3 C-SiC from MD simula- tions, following the methodology detailed in Ref. [10]. AtT= 300 K, classical MD simulations yield C11= 435(1) GPa and C12= 129(1) GPa. Compared to the corresponding values at T= 0 K, obtained using the same TB method, these results reﬂect a thermal-induced reduction of approximately 4% and 8%, respectively [10]. When nuclear quantum eﬀects are included, the elastic responsefurthersoftens: PIMDsimulationsat300Kgive C11= 425(2) GPa and C12= 123(2) GPa [62]. Although the elasticconstant C44is lesscentralto thepresentanal- ysis, we note for completeness that our classical MD and PIMD simulations at 300 K yield values of 238(1) and 235(1) GPa, respectively. We now address the eﬀect of pressure on the elastic constants and its implications for the bulk modulus B and the mechanical stability of the material. In Fig. 6, we show the pressure dependence of C11andC12under hydrostatic conditions at T= 300 K. Open symbols rep- resent data obtained from MD simulations. Under com- pressive stress ( P >0), both stiﬀness constants increase. In contrast, under tensile stress ( P <0), they decrease, withC12becoming negative at P=−27 GPa. This im- plies that the Poisson’s ratio, ν=C12/C11, also becomes negative at this pressure, indicating that cubic SiC ex- hibits auxetic behavior. Notably, C11remains positive throughout the entire pressure range considered, satisfy- ing a key criterion for mechanical stability in crystalline 9 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 Pressure (GPa)-1000100200300400500600Elastic constants (GPa)C11 C12BHydrostatic pressure FIG. 6.

For cubic crystals, the isothermal bulk modulus Bcan be computed from the elastic constantsusing the relation [80, 82]: B=1 3(C11+2C12);. (10) Using the C11andC12values reported above, we ob- tain atT= 300 K and P= 0 a bulk modulus of 231(1) GPa, which falls within the range of experimen- tal values reported in the literature, from 224 GPa [83] to 260 GPa [84]. When nuclear quantum eﬀects are in- cluded, our PIMD simulations yield a bulk modulus of B= 224(1) GPa at the same temperature. In Fig. 6, we show the pressure dependence of the bulk modulus Bat 300 K, alongside the elastic constants. Open squares represent values of Bcalculated from the elastic constants using Eq. (10).

Pressure eﬀects on the electronic band gap In this section, we analyze the evolution of the direct band gap, EΓ, under hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure, with a particular focus on its behavior near mechanical instabilities. Special attention is given to the correla- tion between external pressure, the associated volume changes, and the closure of the band gap at instability points. Electron-phonon interaction leads to a reduction in interband transition energies as temperature increases. A similar decrease occurs at low temperatures due to the zero-point motion of atomic nuclei. In this con- text, band-gap renormalization in semiconductors due to electron-phonon coupling has been analyzed by ex- amining changes in experimental excitation spectra over a broad temperature range [85, 86], as well as through perturbation theory [47, 48]. For the minimum-energy conﬁguration of cubic SiC, the TB Hamiltonian predicts a direct band gap of EΓ= 7.57 eV for the Γv 15→Γc 1transition, consistent with previous ﬁndings [45]. In comparison, Kohn-Sham en- ergy diﬀerences determined within the DFT framework yield a lower value of 6.18 eV. The direct band gap is a well-characterized feature of the electronic structure and serves as a key parameter in our simulations, both clas- sical and PIMD. 1. Hydrostatic pressure Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of the di- rect band gap, EΓ, in 3C-SiC. We present results from both classical MD (solid symbols) and PIMD simulations (open symbols) for hydrostatic pressures of P= 0 (cir- 10 cles), 60 GPa (squares), and −30 GPa (diamonds). In all cases, EΓdecreases with increasing temperature, con- sistent with previous classical and PIMD simulations of 3C-SiC atP= 0 [45]. In the classical zero-temperature limit,EΓincreases under compression, reaching 9.32 eV atP= 60 GPa. Conversely, under tensile pressure , the direct band gap decreases, reaching 5.15 eV at P=−30 GPa. Additionally, we observe a reduction in EΓdue to quantum nuclear motion across the entire temperature range shown in Fig. 7. This eﬀect",
    "the classical zero-temperature limit,EΓincreases under compression, reaching 9.32 eV atP= 60 GPa. Conversely, under tensile pressure , the direct band gap decreases, reaching 5.15 eV at P=−30 GPa. Additionally, we observe a reduction in EΓdue to quantum nuclear motion across the entire temperature range shown in Fig. 7. This eﬀect arises from band-gap renormalizationassociated with electron-phonon interac- tion. Extrapolation of the simulation data indicates a zero-point decrease in EΓof approximately 0.8 eV for bothP= 0 and 60 GPa, while for P=−30 GPa, the reduction is lower at 0.60(2) eV compared to the classi- cal result. In the low-temperature limit, the MSF (∆ r)2 of C atoms is found to be 8 .1, 6.3, and 5 .8×10−3˚A2 forP=−30, 0, and 60 GPa, respectively, indicating a signiﬁcantly larger amplitude of atomic zero-point vibra- tions under tensile stress. A similar trend is observed for the smaller MSF of Si atoms. This behavior is linked to the overall decrease in the mean vibrational frequency ωunder tension, which reduces the impact of zero-point renormalization on EΓdue to electron-phonon coupling. For each applied pressure P, the diﬀerence between classical MD and PIMD results remains noticeable over a wide temperature range in Fig. 7. At T= 750 K, this discrepancy is still evident for P= 0 and 60 GPa, whereas for P=−30 GPa, it falls within the error bars of the data points. The solid lines in Fig. 7 represent ﬁts of the PIMD results to a Bose-Einstein-type expression [45, 87]: EΓ(P,T) =E0 Γ(P)+∆Γ(P)/bracketleftbigg 1+2 exp(Θ P/T)−1/bracketrightbigg , (11) where Θ Pis a pressure-dependent eﬀective temperature, and ∆ Γ(P) represents a negative gap renormalization at T= 0, such that EΓ(P,0) =E0 Γ(P)+∆Γ(P). We obtain ΘPvalues of 1012, 894, and 491 K for P= 60, 0, and −30 GPa, respectively. This trend indicates that under tensile stress, the quantumdata convergemorerapidlyto the classical limit as temperature increases, while under compression,thisconvergenceisslower. ResultsofPIMD simulations for EΓat selected temperatures and hydro- static pressures are summarized in Table II. The faster approach to the classical limit under tension is consis- tent with the lower values of both Θ Pand the Debye temperature Θ D. The behavior of the direct band gap EΓis linked to the variation in the mean phonon frequency ω, which de- creases under tensile stress and increases under compres- sion, as discussed in Sec. III.A. Consequently, at a given temperature T,theaveragethermalpopulationofexcited phonon states is higher under tension and lower under compression. This trend is partially related to changes in the Debye temperature Θ D, which increases for P >0-40 -20 0 20 40 60 Pressure (GPa)0246810Direct band gap EΓ (eV) DFT, T = 0 TB, T = 0 TB, 300 K, MD TB, 300 K, PIMDHydrostatic pressure FIG. 8.

While variations in ΘDcontribute to changes in Θ P, the latter is also in- ﬂuenced by anharmonic eﬀects, which become more pro- nounced with increasing temperature. Moreover, Θ Pis strongly aﬀected by electron-phonon interactions, which themselves depend on pressure [85, 88]. In Fig. 8, we present the pressure dependence of the direct band gap EΓover a broad range, encompassing both tensile and compressive regimes. The solid and dash-dotted lines represent the DFT and TB results at T= 0, respectively. Symbols denote the direct gap ob- tained from classical MD (solid circles) and PIMD sim- ulations (open squares) at T= 300 K. All four sets of results exhibit a similar trend, showing a rapid decrease forP <0 (tension), ultimately approaching gap closure near the corresponding spinodal pressure Ps. Values of EΓderived from quantum simulations ap- pear lower than those from classical simulations for P >−30 GPa. Notably, under compression, the dis- crepancy between the two data sets remains approxi- mately 0.37 eV up to 60 GPa. In contrast, for tensile pressure ( P <−30 GPa), the two data ensembles be- come nearly indistinguishable within the pressure range where∂EΓ/∂Pincreases sharply. Both sets extrapolate toEΓ= 0 atP=−44(1) GPa, which, within error bars, coincideswiththespinodalpressure Psobtainedfromthe divergence of the energy EatT= 300 K (see Sec. III.A and Fig. 2). The direct band gap EΓis closely linked to the bond distance dSi−C. This relationship can be understood within a tight-binding framework, where the evolution 11 TABLE II.

Lines connecting the data points are guides to the eye. ofsandpatomic orbitals into the valence and conduc- tion bands at the Γ point leads to the opening of the electronic gap as nearest-neighbor atoms move closer to- gether [89, 90]. Fig. 9 illustrates the dependence of EΓ ondSi−C. The solid line represents the DFT results at T= 0, while symbols denote values obtained from clas- sical TB-MD (solid circles) and TB-PIMD simulations (open squares) at T= 300 K. The TB-based simulations closely follow the DFT calculations for both large and short bond lengths. However, in the intermediate range, particularly at the equilibrium bond distance of the crys- tal (dSi−C= 1.89˚A), the TB method predicts a higher value ofEΓ. Additionally, for dSi−C<2˚A, the PIMD re- sults are consistently lower than those from classical MD simulations, though both approaches converge at larger bond lengths (stronger tension). This convergence mir- rors the behavior observed for the energy Enear the spinodal pressure Ps, as shown in Fig. 2. The direct band gap EΓobtained from our DFT calcu-lations follows a trend that can be ﬁtted to the function: EΓ=E0 Γ+c1δd+c2(δd)2, (12) whereδd=dSi−C−d0 Si−C, with ﬁtting parameters c1= −18.45 eV/˚A andc2= 7.53 eV/˚A2. This equation pre- dicts a vanishing of the direct band gap ( EΓ= 0) at dSi−C= 2.28(1)˚A, corresponding to a lattice param- eter of 5.26 ˚A. Similarly, extrapolation of TB data at T= 300 K yields EΓ= 0 atdSi−C= 2.27(1)˚A, closely matching the DFT result at T= 0. NearPs, the direct band gap can be expressed through a ﬁrst-order expansion as EΓ=γ(as−a) fora < a s, whereγis a positive constant that may depend on the speciﬁc model under consideration. Substituting in Eq. (7), we obtain EΓ=cγ 3a2s(P−Ps)1/2, (13) which aligns with the behavior observed in Fig. 8 close toPs. The relationship between the constant γand the parameters c1andc2, which describe the dependence of EΓon the bond length, is provided in Appendix B. Our DFT calculations predict an indirect band gap ofEg= 1.24 eV (Γv 15→Xc 1) for the minimum-energy conﬁguration of 3 C-SiC with a lattice parameter of a= 4.36˚A. Under hydrostatic pressure, the behavior of Egcontrasts with that of the direct band gap EΓ:Eg decreases with increasing compression, indicating that ∂Eg/∂P < 0 (see Refs.[91–93]). For instance, when a= 3.6˚A,Egdrops to 0.56 eV. Conversely, under tensile strain,Egincreases, reaching 1.48 eV at P=−38 GPa (a= 5.1˚A), near the spinodal pressure Ps. While our DFT calculations underestimate the indirect band gap compared to experimental values of approximately 2.2– 2.4eVforcubicSiC[94–96], theysuccessfullycapturethe overall pressure-dependent trends. Notably, under ten- sile strain, the direct band gap EΓdecreases and eventu- ally becomesthe smallest orfundamental electronicband gap.

Error bars are of the order of the symbol size. Dashed lines are guides to the eye. 2. Uniaxial pressure We now extend the analysis of the direct band gap EΓ, previouslydetermined under hydrostaticpressure, to examine the eﬀects ofuniaxial pressureapplied alongone of the axes of the cubic unit cell of 3 C-SiC, speciﬁcally thex-axis, where Px=−σxx. In Fig. 10, we present the dependence of EΓon the uniaxial pressure Px. The results from our classical MD simulations at T= 10 K (soliddiamonds)and T= 300K(solidcircles)areshown, alongside those from PIMD simulations at T= 300 K (open squares). For tensile uniaxial pressure ( Px<0), Fig. 10 shows a reduction of the direct band gap with increasing tension, similar to the behavior observed under hydrostatic pres- sure forP <0. However, in this case, EΓreaches a max- imum at Px≈0 before decreasing further under increas- ing compression, eventually reaching a pressure where the direct band gap vanishes. This trend mirrors the anomalies in the lattice parameter and bond length ob- served near −84 GPa and 90 GPa, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 5(a). By considering a low temperature ( T= 10 K), we can approach the instability limits more closely than at higher temperatures, such as 300 K. As Tincreases, ﬂuctuations in the simulation cell volume become more signiﬁcant, leading to the failure of our NPTsimulations before reaching the instability pressure, which coincides with the point at which the Young’s modulus Yvanishes. Near the tensile pressure Pi1 x, the direct band gap EΓ follows a dependence analogous to that observed under hydrostatic pressure (see Eq. (13)): EΓ=A1(Px−Pi1 x)1/2, (14)and similarly, near Pi2 x, we have EΓ=A2(Pi2 x−Px)1/2, (15) whereA1andA2are constants. Fitting our classical simulation results at T= 300 K to Eqs. (14) and (15), using the four data points closest to the instability pres- sure in each case, we obtain Pi1 x=−85(2) GPa and Pi2 x= 92(2)GPa,inagreementwiththeresultspresented inSecs. III.Band III.C. Asimilarﬁtting forthe T= 10K data yields Pi1 x=−90(1) GPa and Pi2 x= 97(2)GPa, indicating a shift of approximately 5 GPa in the insta- bility pressures at lower temperature, thereby expanding the stability region. Notably, extrapolation of the PIMD data shown in Fig. 10 yields instability pressures that, within error bars, are indistinguishable from those de- rived from classical simulations. The hydrostatic component of an applied stress {σij} is given by PH=−1 3Tr(σ) =−1 3(σxx+σyy+σzz),(16) where Tr( σ) denotes the trace of the stress tensor. In the present case, we have PH=Px/3, implying that for the instability pressures Pi1 xandPi2 x, the corresponding hydrostatic components are PH=−28 GPa and PH= 30 GPa, respectively. Notably, the former value is lower than the tensile spinodal pressure:",

In the present case, we have PH=Px/3, implying that for the instability pressures Pi1 xandPi2 x, the corresponding hydrostatic components are PH=−28 GPa and PH= 30 GPa, respectively. Notably, the former value is lower than the tensile spinodal pressure: Ps=−43 GPa. Thevanishingofthedirectbandgap EΓattheuniaxial pressures Pi1 xandPi2 xis directly linked to the vanishing of the Young’s modulus ( Y→0), signaling the onset of mechanical instability in the crystal structure. This instability is reﬂected in the anomalies observed in the lattice parameter and bond length (Figs. 4 and 5). In this context, the vanishing of the Young’s modulus cor- responds to the divergence of the derivative ∂ax/∂Px, as described in Eq. (8). At the instability pressures Pi1 xandPi2 x, the bond lengthdSi−Cconverges to approximately 2.10 ˚A and 1.93˚A, respectively (see Fig. 5(a)). The former, cor- responding to tensile stress, is notably shorter than the bond length obtained at the spinodal point Psunder hy- drostatic pressure ( dSi−C= 2.27˚A). This indicates that the direct band gap collapses under uniaxial pressure (both tensile and compressive) at signiﬁcantly shorter interatomic distances than under hydrostatic pressure, where the cubic crystal structure remains intact. In this context, deviations from cubic symmetry can be quan- tiﬁed by the “tetragonality factor,” deﬁned as the ratio a⊥/axunder uniaxial pressure Px. AtT= 300 K, this ratio varies substantially, ranging from 0.72 at Pi1 x(ten- sion) to 1.68 at Pi2 x(compression), as inferred from the data presented in Fig. 4(a). Under uniaxial pressure, the electronic structure is in- ﬂuenced not only by changes in bond length but also by modiﬁcations in the structural C-Si-C and Si-C-Si bond angles.

A similar behavior is observed for the Si-C-Si angles cen- tered at a carbon atom. These variations highlight the signiﬁcant distortions experienced by the initial tetrahe- dral geometry under the applied pressure Px. Near the instability pressures Pi1 xandPi2 x, we observe a sharp increase in the slope ∂φA/∂Px, resembling the steep pressure dependence of axshown in Fig. 4(a). In con- trast, the variation of ∂φB/∂Pxin these regions is less pronounced. These angle modiﬁcations, combined with changes in bond length, result in substantial variations in next-nearest-neighbor distances (C–C and Si–Si).

SUMMARY In this work we have carried out a systematic com- putational study of 3 C-SiC under hydrostatic as well as uniaxial pressure, covering the pressure range in which the crystal is found to be mechanically stable, both in the compressive and tensile regimes. We have employed a well-tested TB model to describe the system at ﬁnite temperatures, performing simulations in the NPTen- semble, incorporating quantum eﬀects within the PIMD formalism and in the classical limit, so as to gauge the relevance of quantum eﬀects in the studied properties. The validity of the TB model has been checked against ﬁrst-principles zero temperature calculations employing DFT. We have thoroughly characterised the behavior ofthe system total energy, its structural properties and the electronic band gap at ﬁnite temperatures and ten- sile/compressive pressures. Our analysis examines structural properties such as the lattice parameter, Si–C bond length, and bond an- gles, alongwith their ﬂuctuationsasfunctions ofpressure and temperature. The onset of mechanical instability is investigated by evaluating the bulk modulus Bunder hy- drostaticpressureandYoung’smodulus Yunderuniaxial pressure. We have identiﬁed instabilities in the silicon carbide structure under speciﬁc pressure conditions. At T= 300 K, the bulk modulus vanishes under hydrostatic pressure at Ps=−43 GPa, indicating a divergence in compressibility at the spinodal point. Under uniaxial pressure along the [100] crystal axis, the Young’s mod- ulus approaches zero ( Y→0) for a tensile pressure of Pi1 x=−84 GPa and a compressive one of Pi2 x= 90 GPa. These pressures deﬁne the mechanical stability limits of the material. When these limits are reached, several properties exhibit anomalies, with some, such as the lat- tice parameter and its MSF, showing divergences. The directband gap EΓdecreasessigniﬁcantlywith in- creasing temperature and exhibits a rapid reduction un- der tensile strain for both hydrostatic and uniaxial pres- sure. However, under compression, the pressure deriva- tive behaves diﬀerently: ∂EΓ/∂P >0 for hydrostatic pressure, while ∂EΓ/∂Px<0 under uniaxial pressure Px. In all cases, EΓvanishes under pressure conditions that coincide with the loss of mechanical stability. While classical MD simulations provide reasonable ap- proximations for certain properties, such as lattice pa- rameters and bond lengths, other properties are signiﬁ- cantly aﬀected by nuclear quantum eﬀects. Notably, at low temperatures, the direct band gap EΓexhibits pro- nounced quantum contributions due to electron-phonon coupling, leading to a noticeable renormalization of the gap, as shown in Fig. 7. Nuclear quantum motion also manifests in the ﬂuctuations of structural variables, such as bond length, as illustrated in Fig. 5(b). However, it is important to note that these quantum eﬀects do not signiﬁcantly alter the instability pressures Ps,Pi1 x, and Pi2 xobtained from classical MD simulations. Atomistic simulations similar to those presented here can also oﬀer valuable insights into the behavior of re- lated materials, particularly",

Atomistic simulations similar to those presented here can also oﬀer valuable insights into the behavior of re- lated materials, particularly tetrahedral semiconductors, undertensileandcompressivestress. Furthermore,quan- tum nuclear motion can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence various properties of these materials at relatively low tempera- tures. Such eﬀects can be investigated through atomic- scale simulations using techniques like the PIMD method employed in this study.

Appendix A: Debye model Inthe Debyemodel, the vibrationalspectrumofasolid is approximated by a VDOS given by ρD(ω) =Cω2, which extends up to a maximum value ωD, andCis a normalization constant to account for the vibrational degrees of freedom in the material. Using the same nor- malization as that given in Eq. (2), we have /integraldisplayωD 0ρD(ω)dω= 6. (A1) This corresponds to a crystallographic cell including two atoms, so we have: C= 18/ω3 D. In this approximation,the vibrationalenergyper atom at temperature Tis given by: E(T) =EZP+1 2/integraldisplayωD 0n(ω)/planckover2pi1ωρD(ω)dω , (A2) wheren(ω) is the Bose-Einstein factor: n(ω) =/bracketleftbig eβ/planckover2pi1ω−1/bracketrightbig−1, (A3) withβ= 1/kBT(kB, Boltzmann constant). The zero- point energy per atom is given by: EZP=1 2/integraldisplayωD 0/planckover2pi1ω 2ρD(ω)dω . (A4)Note that the prefactor 1 /2 in Eqs. (A2) and (A4) gives the energy per atom. From Eq. (A4), we ﬁnd EZP=9 8/planckover2pi1ωD=9 8kBΘD, (A5) which gives us a relation between the zero-point energy and the Debye temperature Θ D. Appendix B: Fitting of the energy gap We take the DFT results as a reference for the depen- dence of the direct band gap EΓon bond length under isotropic volume changes (or hydrostatic pressure). Us- ing a Taylor expansion for EΓaround the equilibrium bond length, d0 Si−C, we have: EΓ=E0 Γ+c1(dSi−C−d0 Si−C)+c2(dSi−C−d0 Si−C)2,(B1) wherec1,c2are ﬁtting constants. Near the spinodal point, the dependence of EΓon the lattice parameter may be written for a < asas: EΓ=γ(as−a) (B2) whereasisthelatticeparameterforthespinodalpressure Ps. Taking into account that we have for 3 C-SiC the relationa=kdSi−C, withk= 4/√ 3, then ∂EΓ ∂a=c1 k+2c2 k2(a−a0). (B3) Thus, γ=−∂EΓ ∂a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle as= 2c2 k2(a0−as)−c1 k.(B4) This provides us with a relation between the slope of the a–EΓcurve at the spinodal point and the parameters c1 andc2describing the variation of EΓaround the equilib- rium structure.
