    "GLOBAL STRONG SOLUTIONS TO THE3D ROTATING COMPRESSIBLE NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM FOR LARGE DATA IN THE CRITICAL cLpFRAMEWORK MIKIHIRO FUJII AND SHUNHANG ZHANG Abstract.Let us consider the3D compressible Navier–Stokes–Korteweg system in the rotational framework. Although there is a wealth of literature on the weak solutions to this system, there seem to be no results on the strong solutions. In this paper, we show the unique existence of global solutions forlargeinitial data in the critical Besov-type spaces based on the Fourier–Lebesgue spaces cLp(R3) with2⩽p <3, provided that the rotation speed and the Mach number are sufficiently large and small, respectively. The key ingredient of the proof is to establishtheStrichartz-typeestimatesduetothedispersioncausedbythemixture of the rotation and acoustic waves in the Fourier–Lebesgue spaces, and focus on thebetterstructureofdissipationfromtheKortewegtermandthenonlinearterms of the divergence form in the momentum formulation. 1.Introduction This paper is concerned with the initial value problem of the compressible Navier– Stokes–Korteweg system with the Coriolis force in the whole spaceR3, which is one of the models of geophysical flows used to describe the motion of a compressible fluid with capillary effects under the action of the Coriolis force. Regarding the further physical background, we refer to [11,12,20] and references therein. The governing system is given as follows:   ∂tρ+ div(ρu) = 0, t >0, x∈R3, ∂t(ρu) + div(ρu⊗u) + Ω(e 3×(ρu)) +1 ε2∇P(ρ) =µ∆u+ (µ+λ)∇divu+ divK(ρ),t >0, x∈R3, ρ(0, x) =ρ 0(x), u(0, x) =u 0(x), x∈R3.(1.1) Here, since (1.1) is physically well-justified at mid-latitude regions, the centrifugal force is canceled by the natural assumption that the centrifugal force balances with the geostrophic force. The unknownsρ=ρ(t, x)∈(0,∞)andu=u(t, x)∈ R3with(t, x)∈[0,∞)×R3stand for the fluid density and the velocity field, respectively, whileρ 0=ρ 0(x)∈(0,∞)andu 0=u 0(x)∈R3withx∈R3are the supplemented initial data. The constantsµandλare shear and bulk viscosity coefficients, respectively, and satisfyµ >0andν:= 2µ+λ >0. The positive constantεis called the Mach number, which represents the reciprocal of the sound speed. One of the key terms in (1.1) is the Coriolis forceΩ(e 3×(ρu)), which represents the rotation of the fluid around the vertical axise 3= (0,0,1)⊤with the 2020Mathematics Subject Classification.35A01; 35Q35; 76N10; 76U05.

ZHANG constant angular speedΩ∈R. The Korteweg tensorK(ρ)is defined by K(ρ) :=κ 2(∆ρ2− |∇ρ|2) Id−κ∇ρ⊗ ∇ρ, where the constantκ >0is the capillary coefficient. Hence, one may observe that the capillary termdivK(ρ)is expressed by divK(ρ) =κρ∇∆ρ. The pressureP=P(ρ) : (0,∞)→Ris a given function real analytic atρ=ρ ∞ and satisfying P′(ρ∞)>0(1.2) with some positive constantρ ∞>0. This paper treats the system (1.1) as the momentum formulation. More precisely, we define the momentumm:=ρuand then(ρ, m)should solve the following system:   ∂tρ+ divm= 0, t >0, x∈R3, ∂tm+ div\u0012m⊗m ρ\u0013 + Ω(e 3×m) +1 ε2∇P(ρ) =µ∆\u0012m ρ\u0013 + (µ+λ)∇div\u0012m ρ\u0013 + divK(ρ),t >0, x∈R3, ρ(0, x) =ρ 0(x), m(0, x) =m 0(x), x∈R3.(1.3) The clear difference from the velocity formulation is that now the nonlinear terms are of the divergence form, which plays a key role in our calculus.

    "divK(ρ),t >0, x∈R3, ρ(0, x) =ρ 0(x), m(0, x) =m 0(x), x∈R3.(1.3) The clear difference from the velocity formulation is that now the nonlinear terms are of the divergence form, which plays a key role in our calculus. It is well-known that the system (1.3) has an invariant scaling structure; if(ρ, m)is a solution to (1.3), then the scaled functions ρλ(t, x) :=ρ(λ2t, λx), m λ(t, x) :=λm(λ2t, λx)(1.4) also solve (1.3) with the pressurePreplaced byλ2Pfor allλ >0. A norm space Xof distributions onR3is called a critical space with respect to the scaling (1.4) if ∥(ρλ, mλ) (0,·)∥X=∥(ρ, m) (0,·)∥Xfor allλ >0. For instance, ˙B3 p p,q(R3)×˙B3 p−1 p,q(R3) andb˙B3 p p,q(R3)×b˙B3 p−1 p,q(R3)with1⩽p, q⩽∞are the corresponding critical Besov spaces and critical Fourier–Besov spaces1, respectively. The aim of this paper is to consider the solutions to (1.3) around the constant equilibrium state(ρ ∞,0), whereρ ∞is the positive constant appearing in (1.2), and prove the global well-posedness of (1.3) for arbitrarily large initial perturbation in the critical Fourier–Besov spaces frameworkb˙B3 p p,1(R3)×b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3)with2⩽p <3 and some low-frequency assumptions, provided that the|Ω|andεare sufficiently large and small, respectively. As we consider the solutions around the constant equilibrium state(ρ ∞,0), we further reformulate the system (1.3). Without loss of generality, by performing a suitable scaling transform, we reduce the study on (1.3) to the caseρ ∞=P′(ρ∞) = ν= 1; see [29] for the details on this scaling transformation. Let us define the perturbation of the density around the constantρ ∞= 1by a(t, x) :=ρ(t, x)−1 ε, a 0(x) =ρ0(x)−1 ε 1See Section 2 for the precise definition. COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 3 and assume that the given datuma 0is independent ofε. Then, we reformulate (1.3) as  ∂ta+1 εdivm= 0, t >0, x∈R3, ∂tm−µ∆m−(µ+λ)∇divm+ Ω(e 3×m) +1 ε∇a−κε∇∆a=N ε[a, m],t >0, x∈R3, a(0, x) =a 0(x), m(0, x) =m 0(x), x∈R3,(1.5) where Nε[a, m] := div ((I(εa)−1)m⊗m)−µ∆(I(εa)m) −(µ+λ)∇div(I(εa)m)−1 εJ(εa)∇a+κε2∇(a∆a) +κε2 2∇(|∇a|2)−κε2div(∇a⊗ ∇a) with I(b) :=b 1 +b, J(b) :=P′(1 +b)−1. Before presenting our main theorem, we first give a brief overview of existing results relevant to the present study. The pioneering contributions of Danchin [13, 14] are that he established the well-posedness of the compressible Navier–Stokes system (i.e.Ω =κ= 0in (1.1)) in the criticalL2framework by exploiting Sobolev embeddings in the endpoint case for Besov spaces. Building upon this, Danchin and Desjardins [16] investigated the compressible Navier–Stokes–Korteweg system (i.e. Ω = 0in (1.1)):   ∂tρ+ div(ρu) = 0, t >0, x∈R3, ∂t(ρu) + div(ρu⊗u) +1 ε2∇P(ρ) =µ∆u+ (µ+λ)∇divu+κρ∇∆ρ,t >0, x∈R3, ρ(0, x) =ρ 0(x), u(0, x) =u 0(x), x∈R3,(1.6) and proved that if the initial perturbation(a 0, u0) = (ρ 0−1, u 0)is sufficiently small in the critical Besov space( ˙B1 2 2,1(R3)∩˙B3 2 2,1(R3))× ˙B1 2 2,1(R3), then (1.6) has a unique global solution(a, u) = (ρ−1, u)satisfying a,∇a, u∈C([0,∞); ˙B1 2 2,1(R3))∩L1(0,∞; ˙B5 2 2,1(R3)). Subsequently, the extended results within the high-frequencyLpsetting were estab- lished in [7,33], which are comparable to those for the compressible Navier-Stokes system in [6,30].

Subsequently, the extended results within the high-frequencyLpsetting were estab- lished in [7,33], which are comparable to those for the compressible Navier-Stokes system in [6,30]. It is worth noting that theL1-maximal regularity a,∇a∈L1(0,∞; ˙B5 2 2,1(R2)) for the density perturbation stems from the dissipation generated by the Korte- weg termκ∇∆a. This extra dissipative structure yields stronger regularity prop- erties compared to those for the standard compressible Navier–Stokes equations. In fact, [7] demonstrated that the small global solutions to (1.6) enjoy the ana- lytic Gevrey regularity. Furthermore, Kobayashi and Nakasato [34], working in the critical Fourier–Besov framework, improved theL2-regularity for the low-frequency part in [33] and proved global well-posedness of the momentum formulation of (1.6) 4 M. FUJII AND S. ZHANG for small initial perturbation(a 0, m0)in(b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p p,1(R3))×b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3)with 1⩽p⩽∞. On the other hand, it is also a significant topic to consider the singular parameter limits for the compressible flows. Concerning the low Mach number limit of the compressible Navier–Stokes system, Danchin [15,17] proved that the small global solutions in the critical Besov space converge to the incom- pressible Navier–Stokes flow as the Mach numberε→0. In [26], the first au- thor weakened the smallness condition on the initial data in the2D case, show- ing that for arbitrarily large initial perturbation(a 0, u0)in the critical Besov space (˙B0 2,1(R2)∩˙B1 2,1(R2))×˙B0 2,1(R2), thecompressibleNavier–Stokessystemhasaunique global solution provided that the Mach numberεis sufficiently small; moreover, the solution converges to the corresponding large incompressible flow in certain critical space-time norms asε→0. This result was recently extended to the2D compress- ible Navier–Stokes–Korteweg system by the first author and Li [27], in which they established the unique global solvability in the framework of critical Fourier–Besov spaces(b˙B2 p−1 p,1(R2)∩b˙B2 p p,1(R2))×b˙B2 p−1 p,1(R2)for2⩽p <4and analyzed the incom- pressible limit in the low-Mach regime. For the incompressible limits ofλ→ ∞ type, see [9,18,19,38]. We next turn to results concerning the incompressible Navier–Stokes–Coriolis system (i.e.ρ≡1andκ= 0in (1.1)):   ∂tu−µ∆u+ Ω(e 3×u) + (u· ∇)u+∇p= 0, t >0, x∈R3, divu= 0, t⩾0, x∈R3, u(0, x) =u 0(x), x∈R3,(1.7) which was first investigated by Babin, Mahalov and Nicolaenko [1–3]. Subsequently, Iwabuchi and Takada [31,32] and Koh, Lee and Takada [35] analyzed the disper- sive properties of the evolution group{e±iΩtD 3/|D|}t∈Rinduced by the Coriolis force. In particular, they derived Strichartz estimates for the linearized problem, which implies that certain space-time norms of the linear solution can be made arbitrar- ily small by choosing the rotation speed|Ω|sufficiently large. By exploiting this observation, Iwabuchi and Takada [31] and Koh, Lee and Takada [35] proved the global well-posedness of (1.7) for any divergence-free initial datau 0∈˙Hs(R3)with 1/2⩽s <9/10, provided|Ω|is large enough. In contrast to incompressible or non- rotating situations, there are comparatively few results addressing the compressible Navier–Stokes–Coriolis system (i.e.κ= 0in (1.1)):   ∂tρ+ div(ρu) = 0, t >0, x∈R3, ∂t(ρu) + div(ρu⊗u) + Ω(e 3×(ρu)) +1 ε2∇P(ρ) =µ∆u+ (µ+λ)∇divu,t >0, x∈R3, ρ(0, x) =ρ 0(x), u(0, x) =u 0(x), x∈R3.(1.8) In the context of weak solutions to (1.8) in an infinite",

The first analysis of the strong-solution well-posedness for (1.8) inR3appears in the first author and Watanabe’s work [29], where Strichartz estimates for the linearized system were established through dispersion analysis arising from the interplay of the Coriolis effect and acoustic waves. These estimates enabled the proof oflong-timeexistence for (1.8) in the critical Besov setting; more precisely, given any initial perturbation COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 5 (a0, u0)∈( ˙B1 2 2,1(R3)∩˙B3 2 2,1(R3))× ˙B1 2 2,1(R3)and anyT >0, there exists a constant ΩT= Ω T(a0, u0)such that (1.8) has a unique solution on[0, T)wheneverΩ T⩽ |Ω|⩽1/ε. Recently, in a new paper [28], they improved the above result to the global well-posedness; more precisely, for any(a 0, u0)∈( ˙B−3 2 2,∞(R3)∩˙B3 2 2,1(R3))× (˙B−3 2 2,∞(R3)∩˙B1 2 2,1(R3)), there exist positive constantsΩ 0= Ω 0(µ, P, a 0, u0)andc 0= c0(µ, P, a 0, u0)such that ifΩ∈R\\ {0}andε >0satisfyΩ 0⩽|Ω|⩽c 0/ε, then there exists a unique global solution to (1.8). The aim of this paper is to improve the result of [28] to the critical cLpframework inspired by the first author’s previous studies [25,27]. Precisely, we will prove the global well-posedness of the perturbed system (1.5) for large initial data(a 0, m0) in the critical Fourier–Besov spaceb˙B3 p p,1(R3)×b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3)with an additional low- frequency assumption(a 0, m0)∈b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)for2⩽p <3, provided that|Ω|andε are sufficiently large and small, respectively, in the sense1≪ |Ω| ≪1/ε. Here, the Fourier–Besov spaceb˙Bs p,q(R3)is the set of all distributions whose Besov norms, with Lp-norm replaced by the Fourier–Lebesgue cLp-norm, are finite; see the next section for the detailed definition. Our main result now reads as follows. Theorem 1.1.Let2⩽p <3and leta 0∈b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p p,1(R3)andm 0∈ b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3). There exists a positive constantΩ 0= Ω 0(p, µ, κ, P, a 0, u0) andc 0=c0(p, µ, κ, P, a 0, u0)such that ifΩ∈R\\ {0}andε >0satisfies Ω0⩽|Ω|⩽c 01 ε, then the system(1.5)admits a unique global solution(a, m)in the class a, ε∇a, m∈ eC([0,∞);b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3))∩L1(0,∞;b˙B3 p+1 p,1(R3)) withρ(t, x) = 1 +εa(t, x)>0. Remark 1.2.Let us mention some remarks on the auxiliary regularityb˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3). •From the linear analysis2, we see that the linear solutions behave as the semigroup\b e−t∆2 Ω2ε2−∆ t>0, which acts as a forth-order heat kernel in the low frequency part. Let us consider this semigroup in maximalL1-regularity L1(0,∞;b˙B3 p+1 p,1(R3)). Then, we have e−t∆2 Ω2ε2−∆f L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1)⩽C(Ωε)2∥f∥ℓ;|Ω|ε b˙B3 p−3 p,1+C∥f∥h;|Ω|ε b˙B3 p−1 p,1, where the truncated semi-norms appearing in the right-hand side above are defined in Section 2.

There, the third index of the Besov space had to be chosen as∞for technical reasons, which prevented us from obtaining the global 2See Lemma 3.1 and the estimate (3.16) 6 M. FUJII AND S. ZHANG maximalL1-regularityL1(0,∞; ˙B5 2 2,1(R3)). This restriction required a rather complicated argument in proving the global well-posedness. In contrast, in the present Korteweg case, one could similarly take the third index as∞, namelyb˙B3 p−3 p,∞(R3), if one followed the complicated arguments developed in the previous paper. However, since the Korteweg system provides better regularity for the density perturbation, we are able to choose the third index of the auxiliary space as1. This choice yields the maximalL1-regularity L1(0,∞;b˙B3 p+1 p,1(R3)), and allows us to present a comparatively simpler proof of the global a priori estimates. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the definitions and elementary properties of function spaces used in this paper. In Section 3, we prepare some linear estimates. In Section 4, making use of them, we establish the nonlinear global a priori estimates of the local solutions, which are given in the Appendix A, and complete the proof of our main result. Throughout this paper, we denote byCthe constant, which may differ in each line. In particular,C=C(a 1, ..., a n)means thatCdepends only ona 1, ..., a n. For any integrability exponent1⩽p⩽∞, we denote byp′the Hölder conjugate ofp. For two Banach spacesXandYwithX∩Y̸=∅, we write∥·∥ X∩Y:=∥·∥ X+∥·∥ Y. Forf= (f 1, ..., f n)∈Xn, we set∥f∥ X:=∥f 1∥X+...+∥f n∥X. 2.Preliminaries In this section, we briefly introduce the Littlewood-Paley decomposition, some needed function spaces, and some related analysis tools. More details can be found in [4,10,37]. We defineS(R3)as the set of all Schwartz functions onR3andS′(R3)as the set of all tempered distributions onR3. For anyf∈S(R3), its Fourier transform F[f]and inverse Fourier transformF−1[f]are defined as F[f](ξ) = bf(ξ) :=Z R3e−ix·ξf(x)dx,F−1[f](x) := (2π)−3Z R3eix·ξf(ξ)dξ. For any1⩽p⩽∞, we denote byLp(R3)the usual Lebesgue space and by cLp(R3) the Fourier–Lebesgue space, defined as cLp(R3) :=n f∈S′(R3);bf∈L1 loc(R3),∥f∥ cLp:=∥bf∥Lp′<∞o .

COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 7 For anyj∈Zandf∈S′(R2), the dyadic operator ˙∆jand low frequency cut-off operator ˙Sjare defined as follows: ∆jf:=F−1[bϕjbf], S jf:=X j′⩽j−1∆j′f. We denote byP(R3)the set of all polynomials onR3. The following so-called Littlewood-Paley decomposition holds for allf∈S′(R3)/P(R3): f=X j∈Z˙∆jf. Moreover, one may check that ˙∆k˙∆jf= 0if|k−j|⩾2, ˙∆k(˙Sj−1f˙∆jg) = 0if|k−j|⩾5.(2.1) Let us recall the following well-known Bernstein inequalities. Lemma 2.1.Let0< r < R,k∈Nand1⩽p⩽q⩽∞.

For notational simplicity, we set eC(I;b˙Bs p,σ(R3)) :=C(I;b˙Bs p,σ(R3))∩fL∞(I;b˙Bs p,σ(R3)) and eC(I;b˙Bs1 p1,σ1(R3)∩b˙Bs2 p2,σ2(R3)) :=eC(I;b˙Bs1 p1,σ1(R3))∩eC(I;b˙Bs2 p2,σ2(R3)) for1⩽p, p 1, p2⩽∞,1⩽σ, σ 1, σ2⩽∞, ands, s 1, s2∈R. Remark 2.8.By the Minkowski inequality, one easily observes that ∥f∥fLr(I;b˙Bsp,σ)⩽∥f∥Lr(I;b˙Bsp,σ)ifr⩽σ, ∥f∥Lr(I;b˙Bsp,σ)⩽∥f∥fLr(I;b˙Bsp,σ)ifr⩾σ. COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 9 For any0< α < β, the truncated Fourier–Besov norms on the low, middle and high frequencies are defined as follows: ∥f∥ℓ;α b˙Bsp,σ:= {2js∥∆jf∥cLp}2j⩽α ℓσ, ∥f∥m;α,β b˙Bsp,σ:= {2js∥∆jf∥cLp}α<2j⩽β ℓσ, ∥f∥h;β b˙Bsp,σ:= {2js∥∆jf∥cLp}2j>β ℓσ, ∥f∥ℓ;α fLr(I;b˙Bsp,σ):= {2js∥∆jf∥Lr(I;cLp)}2j⩽α ℓσ, ∥f∥m;α,β fLr(I;b˙Bsp,σ):= {2js∥∆jf∥Lr(I;cLp)}α<2j⩽β ℓσ, ∥f∥h;β fLr(I;b˙Bsp,σ):= {2js∥∆jf∥Lr(I;cLp)}2j>β ℓσ. To estimate the nonlinear terms in Besov spaces and Fourier–Besov spaces, we shall use the following Bony decomposition: fg= ˙Tfg+˙Tgf+ ˙R(f, g), where ˙Tfg:=X j∈Z˙Sj−1f˙∆jgand ˙R(f, g) :=X j∈ZX |j′−j|⩽1˙∆jf˙∆j′g. Let us present the basic estimates of the operators ˙T,˙Rin Besov spaces and Fourier–Besov spaces in the following lemma. Lemma 2.9.The following statements hold true: (1) Let1⩽p, p 1, p2, σ⩽∞ands, s 1, s2∈Rsatisfy 1 p=1 p1+1 p2, s=s 1+s2, s 1⩽0.

For the proof of Lemma 2.9, we refer to [4] for the Besov case, and [36] for the Fourier–Besov case. Next, we establish some product estimates in Besov spaces and Fourier–Besov spaces, which play a crucial role in the analysis of the nonlinear terms.

First, we prove the following lemma on the energy estimates of the solutions to (3.1). Lemma 3.1.Let1⩽p, σ, r⩽∞,s∈Rand0< T⩽∞. There exists a positive constantC=C(µ, κ), independent ofΩandε, such that the solution(a, m)to(3.1) satisfies ∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ℓ;|Ω|ε fLr(0,T;b˙Bs+4 rp,σ)⩽C|Ω|2 rε2 r∥(a0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥ℓ;|Ω|ε b˙Bsp,σ +C|Ω|2 rε2 r∥f∥ℓ;|Ω|ε fL1(0,T;b˙Bsp,σ),(3.2) ∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥h;|Ω|ε fLr(0,T;b˙Bs+2 rp,σ)⩽C∥(a 0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥h;|Ω|ε b˙Bsp,σ+C∥f∥h;|Ω|ε fL1(0,T;b˙Bsp,σ).(3.3) Proof.Applying the Fourier transform to (3.1), one has  ∂tba+1 εiξ·bm= 0, ∂tbm+µ|ξ|2bm+ (µ+λ)ξ(ξ·bm) + Ω(e 3×bm) +1 εiξba+κ|ξ|2(εiξba) = bf, ba(0, ξ) =ba 0(ξ),bm(0, ξ) =cm 0(ξ).(3.4) Letℜzand zdenote the real part and the complex conjugate of a complex number zrespectively, and let⟨·,·⟩denote the inner product inC3(that is⟨Z, Y⟩=z 1y1+ z2y2+z3y3forZ= (z 1, z2, z3), Y= (y 1, y2, y3)∈C3). Multiplying the first equation of (3.4) by ba, taking theC3-inner product of the second equation withbm, and then summing up the resulting equalities and taking the real part of the sum, we get 1 2d dt\u0000 |ba|2+|bm|2\u0001 +µ|ξ|2|bm|2+κ|ξ|2ℜ⟨εiξba,bm⟩⩽| bf||bm|, (3.5) COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 13 whereµ := min{µ,1}and we have used the fact that ℜ\u0010 i(ξ·bm) ba+⟨iξba,bm⟩\u0011 = 0, ⟨e3×bm,bm⟩= 0, µ|ξ|2|bm|2+ (µ+λ)|ξ·bm|2⩾µ|ξ|2|bm|2. Multiplying the first equation of (3.4) byεiξgives εiξ∂ tba−(ξ·bm)ξ= 0. (3.6) Taking theC3-inner product of (3.6) withεiξbaand then taking the real part of the resulting equality, we obtain 1 2d dt|εiξba|2− |ξ|2ℜ⟨εiξba,bm⟩= 0, (3.7) where we have used the fact that ⟨(ξ·bm)ξ, εiξba⟩=|ξ|2⟨bm, εiξba⟩.(3.8) Next, taking theC3-inner product of (3.6) and the second equation of (3.4)",

(3.6) Taking theC3-inner product of (3.6) withεiξbaand then taking the real part of the resulting equality, we obtain 1 2d dt|εiξba|2− |ξ|2ℜ⟨εiξba,bm⟩= 0, (3.7) where we have used the fact that ⟨(ξ·bm)ξ, εiξba⟩=|ξ|2⟨bm, εiξba⟩.(3.8) Next, taking theC3-inner product of (3.6) and the second equation of (3.4) withbm andεiξbarespectively, we have ⟨εiξ∂ tba,bm⟩ − |ξ·bm|2= 0, ⟨∂tbm, εiξba⟩+|ξ|2⟨bm, εiξba⟩+ Ωε⟨e 3×bm, iξba⟩ +|ξ|2|ba|2+κ|ξ|2|εiξba|2=⟨bf, εiξba⟩,(3.9) where we have used (3.8) again. Adding up the two equalities in (3.9) and taking the real part of the sum leads to ∂tℜ⟨εiξba,bm⟩+|ξ|2|ba|2+κ|ξ|2|εiξba|2 ⩽|bf||εiξba|+|ξ|2|bm||εiξba|+|Ω|ε|ξ||bm||ba|+|ξ·m|2.(3.10) Letη:= min{1 2,κ 2,κµ 2,µ 4,√κ}>0and define a positive valued function bV=bV(t, ξ) by bV2=bV2(t, ξ) :=\u0000 Ωε2+|ξ|2\u0001\u0000 |ba|2+|bm|2+κ|εiξba|2\u0001 + 2η|ξ|2ℜ⟨εiξba,bm⟩.

Denote by{U Ω,ε(t)}t>0the semigroup associated with the system above, and then, its solution(b(t), v(t))⊤=U Ω,ε(t)(b 0, v0)⊤. Following the proof of (3.5), we obtain 1 2d dt|(bb(t, ξ),bv(t, ξ))|2= 0, which together with the Hausdorff-Young inequality implies ∥˙∆jUΩ,ε(t)(b 0, v0)⊤∥L∞(0,T;Lq)⩽∥bϕj(ξ)(bb(t, ξ),bv(t, ξ))∥L∞(0,T;Lq′) ⩽∥bϕj(ξ)(bb0(ξ),bv 0(ξ))∥Lq′ =∥˙∆j(b0, v0)∥cLq(3.20) for allj∈Z. On the other hand, let0⩽θ⩽1andr 1⩾0satisfy 1 p=θ 2+1−θ q,1 r=θ r1+1−θ ∞. Then, one may see that 2⩽q <∞,1 q+1 r1⩽1 2.

    "q,1 r=θ r1+1−θ ∞. Then, one may see that 2⩽q <∞,1 q+1 r1⩽1 2. It follows from [27, Lemma 3.2] that there exists a positive constantC=C(q, r 1) such that ∥˙∆jUΩ,ε(t)(b 0, v0)⊤∥Lr1(0,T;Lq)⩽C23(1 2−1 q)j|Ω|−1 r1∥˙∆j(b0, v0)∥L2 (3.21) for alljwith2j>|Ω|ε. Therefore, applying the complex interpolation for (3.20) and (3.21) yields ∥˙∆jUΩ,ε(t)(b 0, v0)⊤∥Lr(0,T;Lq)⩽C23(1 p−1 q)j|Ω|−1 r∥˙∆j(b0, v0)∥cLp (3.22) 16 M. FUJII AND S. ZHANG for alljwith2j>|Ω|ε. Thus, multiplying both sides of (3.22) by2(3 q+s)jand then takingℓσ-norm over{j∈Z; 2j>|Ω|ε}, we obtain the following Strichartz estimates for the initial data in Fourier–Besov spaces: ∥UΩ,ε(t)(b 0, v0)⊤∥h;|Ω|ε fLr(0,T; ˙B3 q+s q,σ)⩽C|Ω|−1 r∥(b0, v0)∥h;|Ω|ε b˙B3 p+s p,σ. (3.23) Next, we rewrite (3.1) into  ∂ta+1 εdivm= 0, ∂tm+ Ω(e 3×m) +1 ε∇a=f+µ∆m+ (µ+λ)∇divm+κε∇∆a, a(0, x) =a 0(x), m(0, x) =m 0(x). Then, by the Duhamel principle, we see that\u0012a(t) m(t)\u0013 =U Ω,ε(t)\u0012a0 m0\u0013 +Zt 0UΩ,ε(t−τ)\u00120 f+µ∆m+ (µ+λ)∇divm+κε∇∆a\u0013 (τ)dτ. Hence, resorting to the Strichartz estimates (3.23), we get ∥(a, m)∥h;|Ω|ε fLr(0,T; ˙B3 q+s q,σ)⩽C|Ω|−1 r\u0012 ∥(a0, m0)∥h;|Ω|ε b˙B3 p+s p,σ+∥f∥h;|Ω|ε fL1(0,T;b˙B3 p+s p,σ) +∥m∥h;|Ω|ε fL1(0,T;b˙B3 p+s+2 p,σ )+∥ε∇a∥h;|Ω|ε fL1(0,T;b˙B3 p+s+2 p,σ )\u0013 .(3.24) Recall that (3.3) gives us ∥(m, ε∇a)∥h;|Ω|ε fL1(0,T;b˙B3 p+s+2 p,σ )⩽C∥(a 0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥h;|Ω|ε b˙B3 p+s p,σ+C∥f∥h;|Ω|ε fL1(0,T;b˙B3 p+s p,σ).(3.25) Finally, inserting (3.25) into (3.24) leads to (3.19). This completes the proof.□ 4.Proof of Theorem 1.1 The goal of this section is to prove Theorem 1.1. For the sake of clarity in presentation, we divide the proof into three steps; the first step provides the local well-posedness, the second step establishes the global a priori estimates and we complete the proof in the final step by the continuous argument via the a priori estimates. First step: Local well-posedness We first provide the following local well-posedness result of (1.5). Proposition 4.1.Let1⩽p <3and leta 0∈b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p p,1(R3)andm 0∈ b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3). There exists a positive constantε 0=ε0(p, µ, κ, P, a 0, u0)and a positive timeT 0=T 0(p, µ, κ, P, a 0, u0)such that if0< ε⩽ε 0and0<|Ω|⩽1/ε, then the system(1.5)admits a unique local solution(a, m)in the class a, ε∇a, m∈ eC([0, T 0];b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3))∩L1(0, T 0;b˙B3 p+1 p,1(R3))(4.1) with the estimates ∥εa∥L∞(0,T0;L∞)⩽1/2,∥εa∥ L∞(0,T0;b˙B3 p p,1)⩽c1,(4.2) COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 17 for some constant0< c 1⩽1. The proof of Proposition 4.1 is deferred to Appendix A. Second step: A priori estimates Next, weestablishsomeaprioriestimatesforthesolutionsto(1.5)inthefollowing two lemmas. To simplify the writing, we prepare some notations in the rest of this section. Let(a, m)be the solution to (1.5) on the time interval[0, T max)with the initial dataa 0∈b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p p,1(R3)andm 0∈b˙B3 p−3 p,1(R3)∩b˙B3 p−1 p,1(R3), constructed as in the above proposition. Here,T max∈(T 0,∞]denotes the maximal existence time. For the sake of simplicity, we define Ep(T) :=∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ gL∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)∩gL∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∩L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1), Dp,q,r(T) :=∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ fLr(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r q,1)∩fLr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)+∥ε∇a∥ gL∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1), Ep,0:=∥(a 0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥b˙B3 p−1 p,1∩b˙B3 p−3 p,1 forT∈(0, T max]. Lemma 4.2.Let2⩽p < q <3and2< r <∞satisfy 1 r⩽3 2q−1 4. Then, there exists a constantC 1=C 1(p, q, r, µ, κ, P)⩾1such that for",

Lemma 4.2.Let2⩽p < q <3and2< r <∞satisfy 1 r⩽3 2q−1 4. Then, there exists a constantC 1=C 1(p, q, r, µ, κ, P)⩾1such that for anyΩ∈ R\\ {0}and0< ε⩽ε 0with|Ω|ε⩽1, the solution(a, m)to(1.5)enjoys Ep(T)⩽C 1Ep,0+C 1(1 +D p,q,r(T))D p,q,r(T)E p(T) (4.3) for allT∈(0, T max]. Proof.First of all, we state that the constantc 1in (4.2) is small enough that we can freely use the composition estimates stated in Lemma 2.13 throughout this section; see the proof of Proposition 4.1. Applying Lemma 3.1 to (1.5) and noticing that |Ω|ε⩽1, we have Ep(T) =∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ℓ;|Ω|ε gL∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)∩gL∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∩L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) +∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥h;|Ω|ε gL∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)∩gL∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∩L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1)(4.4) ⩽C∥(a 0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥b˙B3 p−1 p,1∩b˙B3 p−3 p,1+C∥N ε[a, m]∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)∩L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1). Next, we turn to tackle the nonlinear terms in the right-hand side above. By virtue of the embedding relation: ˙B3 2+s 2,1(R3),→b˙B3 p+s p,1(R3)for alls∈R,(4.5) and Lemma 2.11 (with(s, s 1, s3) = (2,3−4 r,3−4 r)and(s, s 1, s3) = (0,1−2 r,1−2 r)), we get ∥div(m⊗m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)⩽C∥m⊗m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−2 p,1) ⩽C∥m⊗m∥ L1(0,T; ˙B−1 2 2,1) ⩽C∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r q,1)∥m∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r′ q,1), 18 M. FUJII AND S. ZHANG ∥div(m⊗m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)⩽C∥m⊗m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1) ⩽C∥m⊗m∥ L1(0,T; ˙B3 2 2,1)(4.6) ⩽C∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥m∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r′ q,1). Based on (4.6), using Lemma 2.10 and Lemma 2.13 in addition, we obtain ∥div(I(εa)m⊗m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1) ⩽C∥I(εa)m⊗m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−2 p,1) ⩽C∥I(εa)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1)∥m⊗m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−2 p,1) ⩽C∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r q,1)∥m∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r′ q,1), ∥div(I(εa)m⊗m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)(4.7) ⩽C∥I(εa)m⊗m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1) ⩽C∥I(εa)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1)∥m⊗m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1) ⩽C∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥m∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r′ q,1). Observe that I(b) =b−bI(b). Hence, making use of Lemma 2.10, Lemma 2.13, (4.5) and Lemma 2.11 (with (s, s 1, s3) = (1,2−4 r,3−4 r)), we have ∥∆(I(εa)m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)+∥∇div(I(εa)m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1) ⩽C∥I(εa)m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1) ⩽C∥εam∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)+C∥εaI(εa)m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1) ⩽C∥εam∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)+C∥I(εa)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1)∥εam∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)(4.8) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)\u0013 ∥εam∥ L1(0,T; ˙B1 2 2,1) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)\u0013\u0012 ∥ε∇a∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r q,1)∥m∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r′ q,1) +∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r q,1)∥ε∇a∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r′ q,1)\u0013 . Thanks to Lemma 2.12 (with(s, s 1, s2) = (1,0,1−2 r)) and Lemma 2.13, we also have ∥∆(I(εa)m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)+∥∇div(I(εa)m)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1) ⩽C∥I(εa)m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 19 ⩽C∥I(εa)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1)∥m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1)(4.9) +C∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥I(εa)∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q+2 r′ q,1) ⩽C∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∥m∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) +C∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥ε∇a∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r′ q,1). LetG(b) :=Rb 0J(s)ds, then we see that 1 εJ(εa)∇a=1 ε2∇(G(εa)). (4.10) Notice thatG(0) =G′(0) = 0, so there exists a smooth functionHsatisfying H(0) = 0such that G(b) =G′′(0)",

LetG(b) :=Rb 0J(s)ds, then we see that 1 εJ(εa)∇a=1 ε2∇(G(εa)). (4.10) Notice thatG(0) =G′(0) = 0, so there exists a smooth functionHsatisfying H(0) = 0such that G(b) =G′′(0) 2b2+H(b)b2. (4.11) Hence, resorting to Lemma 2.10, Lemma 2.13, (4.5), Lemma 2.11 once again, we have 1 ε∥J(εa)∇a∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1) ⩽C ε2∥G(εa)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−2 p,1) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥H(εa)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1)\u0013 ∥a2∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−2 p,1) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)\u0013 ∥a2∥ L1(0,T;b˙B−1 2 2,1) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)\u0013 ∥a∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r q,1)∥a∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r′ q,1), 1 ε∥J(εa)∇a∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)(4.12) ⩽C ε2∥G(εa)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥H(εa)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1)\u0013 ∥a2∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)\u0013 ∥a2∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 2 2,1) ⩽C\u0012 1 +∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)\u0013 ∥a∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥a∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r′ q,1). As for the remaining terms, we can use Lemma 2.10 to bound them as ∥ε2∇(a∆a)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)⩽C∥ε2a∆a∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−2 p,1) ⩽C∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∥ε∇a∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1), ∥ε2∇(a∆a)∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)⩽C∥ε2a∆a∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1) 20 M.

Moreover, we see that ∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−3+4 r′ q,1)⩽C∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ Lr′(0,T;b˙B3 p−3+4 r′ p,1) ⩽C∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)∩L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1), ∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r′ q,1)⩽C∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ Lr′(0,T;b˙B3 p−1+2 r′ p,1) ⩽C∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∩L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1),(4.14) which stems from the embedding relation: b˙B3 p+s p,1(R3),→ ˙B3 q+s q,1(R3)for alls∈R, and the interpolation inequalities: ∥f∥ Lr′(0,T;b˙B3 p−3+4 r′ p,1)⩽∥f∥1 r L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)∥f∥1−1 r L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1), ∥f∥ Lr′(0,T;b˙B3 p−1+2 r′ p,1)⩽∥f∥1 r L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∥f∥1−1 r L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1). Thus, substituting (4.6), (4.7), (4.8), (4.9), (4.12) and (4.13) into (4.4), and using (4.14), we finally obtain desired estimates (4.3).

COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 23 From the proof of Lemma 4.2, we already established that ∥Nε[a, m]∥ L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−3 p,1)∩L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)⩽C(1 +D p,q,r(T))D p,q,r(T)E p(T).(4.23) Hence, it is left to bound∥N ε[a, m]∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1).

Similar to (4.9), using Lemma 2.12, Lemma 2.13 and (4.24) leads to ∥∆(I(εa)m)∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)+∥∇div(I(εa)m)∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1) ⩽C∥I(εa)m∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) ⩽C∥I(εa)∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p p,1)∥m∥h;β 16 L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) +C∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥I(εa)∥ Lr′(0,T; ˙B3 q+2 r′ q,1)(4.26) ⩽C∥ε∇a∥ L∞(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∥m∥h;β 16 L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) +C∥m∥ Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥ε∇a∥1 r−1 Lr(0,T; ˙B3 q−1+2 r q,1)∥ε∇a∥r−2 r−1 L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1). Using Lemma 2.12 and (4.24) once again, we also obtain ∥ε2∇(a∆a)∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)+∥ε2∇(|∇a|2)∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1) +∥ε2div(∇a⊗ ∇a)∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1) 24 M. FUJII AND S.

Therefore, combining (4.25), (4.26) and (4.27), we infer that ∥Nε[a, m]∥h;β L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)⩽C(1 +D p,q,r(T)) [D p,q,r(T)]r r−1[Ep(T)]r−2 r−1 +CD p,q,r(T)∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥h;β 16 L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1).(4.28) In addition, it follows from (3.3) and (4.23) that ∥(a, ε∇a, m)∥h;β 16 L1(0,T;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) ⩽C∥(a 0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥h;β 16 b˙B3 p−1 p,1+C∥N ε[a, m]∥h;β 16 L1(0,T;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)(4.29) ⩽C∥(a 0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥h;β 16 b˙B3 p−1 p,1+C(1 +D p,q,r(T))D p,q,r(T)E p(T). Finally, inserting (4.23), (4.28) and (4.29) into (4.22) yields the desired estimates (4.16). This completes the proof.□ Third step: Global existence Let2⩽p <3. Then, we fix a pair(q, r)∈(p,3)×(2,∞)satisfying (4.15). Moreover, we assume thatΩ∈R\\ {0}andε >0fulfill Ω0⩽|Ω|⩽c 01 ε, (4.30) whereΩ 0⩾1andc 0⩽1are positive constants to be determined later. Hence, due to Proposition 4.1, by takingc 0⩽ε 0, we can construct a unique local solution (a, m)to (1.5) in the class (4.1) that satisfies (4.2). Denote byT maxthe maximal existence time of this local solution. To prove Theorem 1.1, it suffices to prove that Tmax=∞. Next, we define T∗:= sup{T∈(0, T max) ;E p(T)⩽2C 1Ep,0,D p,q,r(T)⩽δ}, (4.31) where the constantC 1is given in Lemma 4.2 and the small positive constantδ⩽1 will be determined later. Letβ >16be a constant to be determined later. Thanks to Lemma 4.2, Lemma 4.3, (4.30) and (4.31), we get that for any0< T < T∗, Ep(T)⩽C 1Ep,0+ 2C2 1(1 +δ)δE p,0, Dp,q,r(T)⩽C 2\u0010 c2 r 0+c0Ω−1 0β+|Ω 0|−1 rβ2−2 r(1 +c 0Ω−1 0β)\u0011 COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 25 ×(E p,0+ 2C 1(1 +δ)δE p,0) +C 2(1 +δ)∥(a 0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥h;β 16 b˙B3 p−1 p,1 + 2C 1C2(1 +δ)δr r−1Er−2 r−1 p,0+ 2C 1C2(1 +δ)δ2Ep,0.

Now, we first chooseδsufficiently small to satisfy C1(1 +δ)δ⩽1 4, 2C1C2(1 +δ)δ1 r−1Er−2 r−1 p,0⩽1 8, 2C1C2(1 +δ)δE p,0⩽1 8. Then, we setβsufficiently large such that 2C2∥(a0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥h;β 16 b˙B3 p−1 p,1⩽δ 8. Furthermore, we takeΩ 0sufficiently large andc 0sufficiently small so that 5C1C2Ep,0\u0010 c2 r 0+c0Ω−1 0β+|Ω 0|−1 rβ2−2 r(1 +c 0Ω−1 0β)\u0011 ⩽δ 8. Thus, at this stage, we arrive at that for any0< T < T∗, Ep(T)⩽3C1 2Ep,0,D p,q,r(T)⩽δ 2. Based on the estimates above and (4.31), by using a standard continuity argument, wecanconcludethatT max⩾T∗=∞. Hence, theproofofTheorem1.1iscompleted. AppendixA.Proof of Proposition 4.1 We present the proof of Proposition 4.1. Proof of Proposition 4.1.LetT >0.

Hence, there exists a positive constantε 0such that ∥ε∇ea ε∥ gL∞(0,∞;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)⩽1 8C0 for all0< ε⩽ε 0. Suchεis fixed from now on. Reverting to (3.16) and noticing that|Ω|ε⩽1, we see that ∥˙∆j(eaε, ε∇ea ε,fmε)∥cLp ⩽Ce−24j C(Ω2ε2+22j)t∥˙∆j(a0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥cLp ⩽( Ce−C−124jt∥˙∆j(a0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥cLpif2j⩽1, Ce−C−122jt∥˙∆j(a0, ε∇a 0, m0)∥cLpif2j>1. COMPRESSIBLE ROTATING NAVIER–STOKES–KORTEWEG SYSTEM 29 Then, by virtue of Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, there exists a positive timeT 0independent ofΩandεsuch that ∥eaε∥ L2(0,T0;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∩L2(0,T0;b˙B3 p p,1)+∥ε∇ea ε∥ L2(0,T0;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∩L2(0,T0;b˙B3 p p,1)∩L1(0,T0;b˙B3 p+1 p,1) +∥fm ε∥ L2(0,T0;b˙B3 p−1 p,1)∩L2(0,T0;b˙B3 p p,1)∩L1(0,T0;b˙B3 p+1 p,1)⩽1 8C0. Hence, we have ∥(eaε,fmε)∥Zε T0⩽1 4C0. At this stage, we arrive at ∥Φε[a, m]∥ Zε T0⩽∥(ea ε,fmε)∥Zε T0+C 0∥(a, m)∥2 Zε T0 ⩽1 4C0+C 0\u00121 2C0\u00132 =1 2C0, which indicates thatΦ ε[a, m]∈Zε T0for(a, m)∈Zε T0. In a similar fashion, we also can conclude that there exists a positive constantC 3such that ∥Φε[a2, m2]−Φ ε[a1, m1]∥Zε T0 ⩽C 3\u0010 ∥(a2, m2)∥Zε T0+∥(a 1, m1)∥Zε T0\u0011 ∥(a2−a1, m2−m 1)∥Zε T0 for all(a 2, m2),(a 1, m1)∈Zε T0.
