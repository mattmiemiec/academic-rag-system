This system describes an Ellis-type wormhole situated at the center of an axion star. By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the potential’s decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the wormhole’s throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole’s embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat. ∗jcwang@hunnu.edu.cn, corresponding author 1arXiv:2509.19822v2 [gr-qc] 28 Sep 2025 I. INTRODUCTION The twin puzzles of dark matter and dark energy stand as formidable challenges at the frontiers of modern cosmology and gravitational theory. Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) [1, 2] and independent evidence from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [3, 4] have provided compelling support for the existence of a negative-pressure component known as “dark energy.” This dark energy can be simply parameterized by its equation of state,k=p d/ρd, wherep dis the spatially homogeneous pressure andρ dis the dark energy density [5]. For cosmic expansion, the conditionk <−1/3 must be satisfied, withk=−1 corresponding to the cosmological constant [6]. In addition to the standard candidate range of−1≤k <−1/3 [7, 8], recent theoretical considerations have also explored the case wherek <−1 [9–11]. This latter scenario violates the null energy condition and other energy conditions. This hypothetical substance is often termed “phantom energy” and could mediate a long-range repulsive force [12], a possibility that could not be observationally ruled out even in recent measurements [13]. While cosmological phantom energy models face significant theoretical challenges, the underlying mechanism—a scalar field with a negative kinetic term—provides a straightfor- ward and widely used theoretical tool for modeling the “exotic matter” required for the construction of traversable wormholes[14–16]. The wormhole concept originates from the work of Einstein [17], with the term coined by Wheeler [18], and is of significant interest in various models of quantum gravity [19]. For the traversable wormholes, the simplest scenario involves a phantom scalar field acting as the source of such exotic matter, thereby providing the necessary support for the wormhole structure [20–22].

    "quantum gravity [19]. For the traversable wormholes, the simplest scenario involves a phantom scalar field acting as the source of such exotic matter, thereby providing the necessary support for the wormhole structure [20–22]. Following the seminal work of Morris and Thorne in 1988 [23], research on traversable wormholes has expanded to include numerous aspects [24–33]. More recently, various models for traversable wormholes have been proposed that either do not violate the energy condition [34] or do not require exotic matter [35–38]. Parallel to the mystery of dark energy is the enduring puzzle of dark matter. Among the myriad proposed candidates, scalar field models have gained significant traction [39–41]. Some of these scalar fields can form extended, gravitationally bound objects, ranging in size from microscopic particles to vast galactic halos. These are known as boson stars [42–45], and these extended compact objects have the potential to mimic the observational signatures of 2 dark matter [46]. However, one of the most compelling current dark matter candidates is the axion [47, 48]. The axion is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson whose non-derivative coupling to the Standard Model arises solely from topological charges [49]. While originally proposed by Peccei and Quinn to resolve the strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), axions have since become a paradigm for ultralight, feebly interacting bosons beyond the Standard Model [50–54]. Analogous to other scalar theories, the axion field can form its own gravitationally bound configurations known as axion stars [55–58], arising from the minimal coupling of the axion field to gravity. Recent work has investigated rotating axion stars [59], as well as multi-field configurations that involve the mixing of a rotating axion star with other bosonic fields and the tidal effects on axion stars [60, 61]. A compelling avenue of research opens when we move beyond studying these phenomena in isolation and instead consider hybrid configu- rations: nontrivial spacetime, such as wormholes supported by phantom fields, that also harbor additional matter fields. Although these components are traditionally considered on different physical scales—from the cosmological to the astrophysical, studying their interplay in a single, localized system serves as a valuable theoretical laboratory. Previous work has already explored wormhole systems coupled to ordinary scalar fields [62–64], Proca fields [65], fermionic fields [66], and nonlinear electromagnetic fields [67]. These studies under- score a key insight: introducing a wormhole almost invariably alters the properties of the corresponding gravitational solution in trivial topology [68], and the specific nature of the coupled matter field has a significant impact on the resulting wormhole spacetime [69, 70]. Motivated by the possibility of non-trivial interactions within the dark sector[71], it is compelling to investigate models where candidates for these phenomena are coupled in ex- treme gravitational environments. Therefore, in this paper, we numerically construct and analyze a spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat configuration composed of an axion scalar field and a massless real phantom field minimally coupled to gravity. We systemat- ically investigate how three key parameters: the decay constantf a, the field frequencyω, and the throat parameterr 0influence the system’s physical properties.

We systemat- ically investigate how three key parameters: the decay constantf a, the field frequencyω, and the throat parameterr 0influence the system’s physical properties. The traversability of the wormhole is evaluated through an analysis of the curvature scalar and energy conditions of the static solution. Finally, we study the model’s null-geodesics and the corresponding light rings. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the model four-dimensional 3 Einstein gravity coupled to a phantom field and a axion field. In Sec. III, the boundary conditions are studied. The numerical results of the three different cases are discussed in Sec. IV. We conclude in Sec. V with a summary and illustrate the range for future work. II. THE MODEL A. Action We consider the Einstein-Hilbert action including the Lagrangian for the axion field and the phantom scalar field, the action is given by S=Z√−gd4x\u0012R 2κ+L p+L a\u0013 ,(1) whereRis the Ricci scalar. The termL pandL aare the Lagrangians defined by with Ls=−∇ aΨ∗∇aΨ−V(|Ψ|2), Lp=∇ aΦ∇aΦ.(2) Here Ψ and Φ represent the complex axion scalar field and the phantom field, respectively. By varying the action (1) with respect to the metric, we can obtain the Einstein equations Rµν−1 2gµνR−κT µν= 0,(3) with stress-energy tensor Tµν=gµν(La+L p)−2∂(L a+L p) ∂gµν.(4) The equations governing the matter fields are derived by performing variations with respect to both the phantom field and the axion field, which are □Ψ−∂V ∂|Ψ|2Ψ = 0,(5) and □Φ = 0.(6) 4 B. Ansatze We consider the general static spherically symmetric solution with a wormhole, and adopt the Ansatzes as follows, seee.g.[68]: ds2=−eAdt2+Ce−A\u0002 dr2+h(dθ2+ sin2θdφ2)\u0003 ,(7) hereAandCare functions of radial coordinater,h=r2+r2 0with the throat parameter r0. andrranges from positive infinity to negative infinity. It should be emphasized that the two limitsr→ ±∞correspond to two distinct asymptotically flat spacetime. Furthermore, we assume stationary axion complex scalar field and phantom field in the form Ψ =ψ(r)eiωt,Φ =ϕ(r).(8) Here,ψis only a real function of the radial coordinater, and the constantωis referred to as the synchronization frequency. Moreover, the phantom field Φ is also a real function and is independent of the time coordinatet. The potential of axion field is V(ψ) =2µ2f2 a B\" 1−s 1−4Bsin2\u0012ψ 2fa\u0013# ,(9) whereBis a constant related to the ratio of the up quark massm uto the down quark massm d, withm u/md≈0.48, givingB≈0.22,µandf aare two free parameters. In this potential, the second term corresponds to the QCD axion effective potential [72], and the addition of a constant term ensuresV(0) = 0, in order to construct asymptotically flat axion stars. Expanding the potential aroundψ 0= 0, one obtains V(ψ) =µ2ψ2−\u00123B−1 12\u0013µ2 f2 aψ4+. . . .(10) It can be observed thatµrepresents the mass of the axion, whilef adenotes the decay constant of the axion field. Whenf a≫ψ, only the free scalar potential remains, and the model reduces to the nontrivial topology mini-boson stars [62–64]. 5 C.

(16) Together with Eq.(11) they form a system of second order ODEs to be solved numerically. Before going any further, we want to make two points: Firstly, when the axion field vanish, one can derive the solution for an Ellis wormhole. Secondly, the throat parameter cannot be smoothly set to zero, preventing the model from reverting to the standard axion star solution. However, in the limit as this parameter approaches zero, the model’s physical properties asymptotically converge to those of the standard axion star solution. In numerical calculations, we are particularly concerned about the results of some physical quantities, including the ADM mass of the gravitational system, can be read off directly from 6 the asymptotic expansion of the metric componentg tt gtt=−1 +2M r+···,(17) the Noether charge from the invariant under theU(1) transformation of the axion field Q=Z SJt s =−Z Jt|g|1/2drdΩ 2,(18) with the conserved current Jµ=−i(ψ∗∂µψ−ψ∂µψ∗), Jµ ;µ= 0.(19) In addition, we focus on the Kretschmann scalarRµνρσRµνρσof this model, the expres- sion is very long and not displayed here.

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS Before numerically solving the differential equations instead of seeking the analytical solutions, we should provide appropriate boundary conditions. Unlike in the study of boson stars with trivial topology, our analysis of wormhole space- times requires no restrictions at the origin. Instead, only need to satisfy the asymptotic flatness conditions: ψ=A= 0, C= 1,(22) 7 at infinity (r→ ∞). In this work, all the numbers are dimensionless as follows r→rµ , ψ→ψκ−1/2, ω→ω/µ.(23) Without loss of generality, we can fix the specific parameters asµ= 1 andκ= 2. To facilitate numerical calculations, we transform the radial coordinates by the following equation x=2 πarctan(r),(24) map the infinite region (−∞,+∞)",

To facilitate numerical calculations, we transform the radial coordinates by the following equation x=2 πarctan(r),(24) map the infinite region (−∞,+∞) to the finite region (-1,1). This allows the ordinary differential equations to be approximated by algebraic equations. The grid with 2000 points covers the integration region and the relative errors are less 10−5. IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS A. ADM mass and Noether charge We select a representative set of parameters for our analysis: the decay constant is set to fa={1.0,0.12,0.10}, and the throat parameter tor 0={0.0001,0.1,0.5,0.8}. The results are then grouped, with one parameter held constant in each case to investigate its specific influence. This range of parameters is sufficiently broad to explore the distinct physical properties of the model. The domain of existence of the nontrivial topology axion star solutions for different decay constantf ain an ADM massM/ Noether chargeQvs. frequencyωdiagram is shown in Fig. 1. Whenf a= 1, the curves of massMand chargeQare very similar to those of boson stars with wormhole spacetime topology [62, 63]. This characteristic persists under different values of the throat parameter. Specifically, the curves exhibit a spiral shape with a tight winding at smaller values of ther 0, which opens up as ther 0increases. This behavior suggests that in the large values off a, the axion star solution degenerates into a mini-boson star model. It is noteworthy that as the parameterf adecreases, whenr 0is smaller, the curve exhibits a “duckbill” shape. In contrast, whenr 0is large, the curve maintains a spiral expansion. From the perspective of catastrophe theory and the numerically evolved analysis[82–84] axion stars with smallerf a, exhibit two stable branches separated by an unstable region. 8 FIG. 1. The ADM massMand Noether chargeQas the function of frequencyωfor some values offaunderr 0= 0.0001,0.1,0.5,0.8. However, it remains to be seen whether these conclusions hold in the context of wormhole spacetimes. To facilitate a future stability analysis and data extraction, we present in I the point corresponding to the maximum mass on the first branch for variousr 0solutions under two distinct sets of the parameterf a. In a trivial spacetime, this specific point delineates the boundary between stable Newtonian and unstable branches. Except to the ADM mass and the corresponding frequency, we also show the numerical value of the axion scalar field ψ0atx= 0 at this time. B. Phantom scalar charge and The Kretschman scalar The nature of a wormhole is intimately linked to its throat parameterr 0. In particular, the magnitude ofr 0directly influences the wormhole’s traversability.

For a throat parameter ofr 0= 0.0001, the Kretschmann scalarKis exceptionally large, exhibiting a divergent trend near the throat, irrespective of the values of thef aand frequency ω. A consistent observation is that asr 0increases, the overall value of the Kretschmann scalar progressively decreases. In the case wherer 0= 0.1, the Kretschmann scalar of the second solution branch is found to be smaller than that of the first branch, given the same parameters. Whenr 0= 0.5 for fixed value off a, the Kretschmann scalar initially decreases as the frequency is lowered. After reaching a minimum value, it begins to increase with a further decrease in frequency. This behavior is preserved for larger values ofr 0. We show the diagram ofKas a function of the radial coordinatexin Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of a physical quantity closely related to the wormhole throat parameter: the phantom field scalar chargeD. The value of this quantity serves as a measure for the phantom field content within the model. We find that the scalar charge exhibits a positive correlation with the throat parameterr 0, while the parameterf ahas a negligible effect on it. In summary, for extremely small throat parametersr 0, the value of the parameterD 10 FIG. 2. The Kretschmann scalar vs. radial coordinatexunder different values ofr 0andf a. indicates a scarcity of the phantom field, while the corresponding Kretschmann scalarK is of a high order of magnitude, signifying a violation of traversability. Asr 0increases,D also increases whileKgenerally decreases. However, in this regime, the value ofKis also influenced by the parametersf aand frequency. C. Energy Condition Generally, a wormhole model supported by a phantom field violates the null energy condition, and consequently the weak and strong energy conditions. However, this situation may change in certain parameter regimes when other matter fields are also coupled to the system. In Fig. 4, we show the distribution of the system’s energy densityρand the sum of energy density and radial pressureρ+p rfor various throat parametersr 0and frequency 11 FIG. 3. The phantom field scalar chargeDvs. radial coordinatexunder different values ofr 0and fa. ω. Since the parameterf ahas a negligible impact on the results, we have selected only one representative value off afor each group. A more interesting situation arises for relatively large throat parameters, specifically for the cases ofr 0= 0.5 andr 0= 0.8. In the case ofr 0= 0.5, we observe that as the frequency decreases, both theρand theρ+p rprogressively increase. For a sufficiently small frequency ω, these quantities become positive, indicating that the null energy condition (NEC) is no longer violated throughout the entire spacetime. In contrast, forr 0= 0.8,",
    "0= 0.8. In the case ofr 0= 0.5, we observe that as the frequency decreases, both theρand theρ+p rprogressively increase. For a sufficiently small frequency ω, these quantities become positive, indicating that the null energy condition (NEC) is no longer violated throughout the entire spacetime. In contrast, forr 0= 0.8, while the general trends described above persist, the NEC at the throat remains violated even in the low- frequency limit. Interestingly, two symmetric regions emerge near the throat where the NEC is satisfied. 12 This phenomenon is, of course, a result of the combined contribution of the axion scalar field and the phantom field. The former provides positive energy density, while the latter supplies the necessary negative energy. However, this behavior is not universal across all models. The properties of gravitational configurations formed by mixing various normal matter fields with phantom fields are governed by the interplay between these two types of “normal” and “exotic” matter, leading to a rich variety of complex possibilities. D. Wormhole Geometries We now turn to the geometry of the wormholes within the axion boson stars. We can make use of a geometrical embedding diagram by fixingtandθ. The resulting two-dimensional spatial hypersurface of the wormhole spacetime can then be embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, where the embedding diagram can be used to visualize the wormhole ge- ometry. This technique allows us to better understand the topology and properties of the wormhole solution. The specific method is: we begin by constructing the embeddings of planes withθ=π/2, and then use the cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z), the metric on this plane can be expressed by the following formula ds2=Ce−Adr2+Ce−Ahdφ2 =dρ2+dz2+ρ2dφ2.(25) Comparing the two equations above, we then obtain the expression forρandz, ρ(r) =q C(r)e−A(r)h(r), z(r) =±Zs C(r)e−A(r)−\u0012dρ dr\u00132 dr .(26) Hereρcorresponds to the circumferential radius, which corresponds to the radius of a circle located in the equatorial plane and having a constant coordinater. The functionρ(r) has extreme points, where the first derivative is zero. When the second derivative of the extreme point is greater than zero, we call this point a throat, which corresponds to a minimal surface. When the second derivative of the extreme point is less than zero, we call this point an equator, which corresponds to a maximal surface. Due to the solution’s symmetry with respect to the origin, the wormhole exhibits one of two possible topological configurations: a single throat centered atz= 0, or a pair of throats 13 FIG. 4. Energy densityρand the sum of energy density and radial pressureρ+p rfor various throat parametersr 0and frequencyω. situated symmetrically on either side of a equatorial plane which is located atz= 0. We found that for relatively small values of the throat parameterr 0, the wormhole consistently has a single throat and no equatorial plane, irrespective of the values of the axion decay constantf aand frequencyω. A more complex behavior emerges asr 0increases to a value that allows for very small frequencies. For instance, whenf a= 1, the wormhole has a single throat at large frequencies.

For instance, whenf a= 1, the wormhole has a single throat at large frequencies. However, asωbecomes very small, a single throat gives way to an equatorial plane appearing at the wormhole’s center. In contrast, for small values off a, such as 0.12 or 0.1, the single- 14 FIG. 5.

We present the corresponding two sets of wormhole embedding diagrams in Fig. 5. E. Null geodesics and Light Ring Finally, we analyze the null geodesics and the resulting light ring within the model’s equa- torial plane, a simple yet physically significant configuration. Refs. [73, 74] have separately calculated the light ring characteristics for extremely compact relativistic stars such as boson stars, and for wormholes. Given that our model can be viewed as a wormhole spacetime with axion star properties, its light ring structure should resemble that of a general axisymmetric stationary wormhole. Photons in a gravitational field move along null geodesics which is given by gµν˙xµ˙xν= 0,(27) and in our casexµ= (t, r, θ, φ), the dots represent derivatives with respect to the affine parameterλalong the geodesics. Due to the static character and the spherical symmetry of 15 the system, we can assume that the orbit lies in the equatorial planeθ=π/2 and defines two conserved quantities:Conserve energyE=−g tt˙tand the angular momentumL=g φφ˙φ. Taking into account the relevant metric components, the geodesic equation can be written as (re-scaling the affine parameter asλ=λ/L) ˙r2+1 gtt1 grr(1 b2+gtt gφφ) = ˙r2+1 C(eA Ce−Ah−1 b2) = 0,(28) where the impact parameter asb≡L Efor a certain null particle. We define the effective potentialV effis Veff=eA Ce−Ah,(29) where the extreme pointsr LRsatisfy dVeff dr rLR= 0.(30) FIG. 6.

The corresponding orbits of the null particle are then referred to as the light ring. Moreover, for the maximum point of the effective potential,V′′ eff(rLR)<0, the light ring corresponding tor LRis unstable. On the contrary, the minimum point of the effective potential corresponds to a stable light ring. FIG. 7. The illustrations of the light ring for three different parameters. The left panel shows the solution with three light rings, while the right panel depicts a single photon ring located at the throat.

In the Fig. 6, we find that the effective potential exhibits an extreme value atx= 0, which may correspond to either a stable or an unstable orbit, regardless of the values of the parameters. In certain parameter regimes, multiple extreme points can emerge throughout the wormhole spacetime. For instance, as shown in the figure, three such extreme points are 17 observed. The number of unstable orbits is always one greater than the number of stable orbits, a finding that is consistent with the conclusion of a previous study [74]. Moreover, Fig. 7 provides an illustrative diagram as for the light ring. We choose the r0= 0.1,0.8 withω= 0.9,0.5 respectively underf a= 1.0 corresponding the three light rings. The illustrative diagram at the right panel show the single light ring situations. V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of a gravitational model featur- ing a nontrivial spacetime topology, comprising an axion field as a dark matter candidate and a phantom field as a dark energy candidate. This model shares features with known phantom-energy wormhole solutions but also displays unique properties. As the throat pa- rameter increases and the axion decay constant decreases, the mass and charge curves versus frequency evolve from a tight spiral to a “duckbill” shape, then to a loose spiral. For small throat parameters, the Kretschmann scalar is orders of magnitude larger and diverges near the throat, indicating a breakdown in traversability. Although it generally decreases with larger throat parameters, the scalar can increase at low frequencies-behavior linked to en- ergy condition distributions. While the NEC is violated throughout spacetime, it holds in certain parameter ranges. Embedding diagrams show that the wormhole usually has one throat, but under special conditions, it can develop an equatorial plane and a double-throat structure. Furthermore, astronomical observational studies of wormhole models have been on the rise, including research on light rings and shadows [76, 77], gravitational lensing [78], and gravitational waves [79, 80]. We analyze the null geodesics of our model as a simple yet powerful probe. It is found that the model either possesses a single unstable light ring at the throat, or, in addition, it has multiple pairs of light rings in the external spacetime. Regardless of the configuration, the number of unstable light rings is always one greater than the number of stable ones. Our analysis of traversability was limited to a preliminary study by computing the Kretschmann scalar at the throat of the static solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of a wormhole’s traversability necessitates a full stability analysis [81] and the complete numerical evolution of a test particle as it traverses the wormhole [75]. Building upon existing work, these topics will constitute our next research 18 direction.
