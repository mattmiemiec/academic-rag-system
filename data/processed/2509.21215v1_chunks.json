    "Spin band geometry drives intrinsic thermal spin magnetization and current Sankar Sarkar, Harsh Varshney, Sayan Sarkar, and Amit Agarwal∗ Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur-208016, India Generating spin magnetization and spin currents without magnetic or electric fields is a key frontier in spin caloritronics. Spin responses driven by thermal gradients offer a promising route, though the band geometric origin of intrinsic mechanisms, especially in non-magnetic materials, remains poorly understood. Here we develop a unified quantum theory of thermal spin magnetization and spin currents in itinerant electrons, rooted in spin band geometry with both Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea contributions. We identify two key geometric quantities: the spin-velocity metric tensor, which governs thermal spin magnetization, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry curvature and spin quantum metric, which generates thermal spin currents. These intrinsic contributions persist and can even dominate in non-magnetic insulators. Numerical calculations for chiral metal RhGe and antiferromagnet CuMnAs demonstrate sizable thermal spin responses near band crossings. Our results establish the band geometric origin of thermal spin transport and provide guiding principles for discovering and engineering next-generation spin caloritronic materials. Introduction:–The ability to generate and control spin magnetization and spin currents without relying on mag- netic fields is a central challenge for next-generation spintronic technologies [1–8]. Thermal gradients, nat- urally present in micro- and nanoscale devices, provide a compelling route to drive such spin responses in an energy-efficient manner compatible with device minia- turization. Thermally induced spin responses, such as thermal spin magnetization (TSM)[9–12] and thermal spin currents (TSC)[13–18], enable heat-to-spin conver- sion and promise low-power spin-caloritronic applica- tions [19, 20], with implications for high-speed, energy- efficient memory and computing devices [7, 21–23]. Most prior studies have focused on current-induced spin magnetization in inversion-broken systems [24–26] and on spin Hall currents in non-magnetic systems pre- serving time-reversal symmetryT[27–29]. In con- trast, thermally generated spin responses have received comparatively less attention. Existing studies of spin- caloritronic effects [30–32] emphasize magnon-mediated transport in ordered magnets, while corresponding mech- anisms for Bloch electrons in non-magnetic systems re- main unexplored. By comparison, charge transport is firmly understood as a band-geometric phenomenon gov- erned by Berry curvature and quantum metric [33–43]. Yet, the role of band geometry in thermal spin transport has not been clarified. Although recent works have linked quantum geometry to current-induced spin responses, a parallel framework for thermal driving, essential for har- nessing waste heat in non-magnetic platforms, remains absent. This gap limits progress toward next-generation spin-caloritronic materials and devices and motivates the central question of this work:Can the spin band geometry of Bloch electrons drive robust thermal spin magnetiza- tion and currents in systems without net magnetic order? In this Letter, we develop a unified quantum theory of thermally induced spin transport using the density- matrix formalism. We show that intrinsic (scatter- ing–independent) TSM and TSC are governed by two FIG. 1.Schematic of thermally driven spin responses: A temperature gradient generates an imbalance between up and down spins of itinerant electrons due to spin-orbit cou- pling, leading to spin magnetization (δS) and current (JS). spin-band-geometric quantities: the spin-velocity met-",
    "that intrinsic (scatter- ing–independent) TSM and TSC are governed by two FIG. 1.Schematic of thermally driven spin responses: A temperature gradient generates an imbalance between up and down spins of itinerant electrons due to spin-orbit cou- pling, leading to spin magnetization (δS) and current (JS). spin-band-geometric quantities: the spin-velocity met- ric tensor, which controls TSM, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry curvature and spin quan- tum metric [44–48], which governs TSC. We also iden- tify extrinsic scattering-dependent contributions arising from band velocity and anomalous spin velocity. A comprehensive symmetry analysis decomposes these re- sponses intoT-even andT-odd parts, providing a com- plete classification of the TSM and TSC responses across all 122 magnetic point groups. Our first-principles and model calculations confirm sizable TSM and TSC inT-symmetric RhGe andT-broken CuMnAs, which are strongly enhanced near the band edges and Dirac crossings. Together, these results establish a band- geometric framework for thermal spin transport and offer symmetry-guided design principles for discovering next- generation spin-caloritronic materials. Thermal spin magnetization and current:–A uniform temperature gradient can induce steady-state spin mag- netization and current in itinerant electrons, even in non- magnetic materials. To capture these responses quanti- tatively, we define the spin polarization and spin currentarXiv:2509.21215v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 25 Sep 2025 2 as [5, 49–54] δSγ(ω) =⟨ˆsγ⟩ ≡X kTr[ ˆsγˆρ],(1a) Jγ;a(ω) =⟨ ˆJγ;a⟩ ≡X kTr[ˆJγ;aˆρ].(1b) Here, ˆsγdenotes the operator for spins, polarized along γ∈(x, y, z), while the spin current operator ˆJγ;a= (1/2){ˆva, sγ}describes the flow of spins, polarized along γ, in thea-direction with velocity ˆv. The nonequilibrium density matrix ˆρ(k, t) encodes the system’s response to a harmonically varying time-dependent thermal gradient of frequencyω[42, 55, 56],E T(t) =−(∇T/T) [eiωt+ e−iωt]/2.We treat this thermal field as a Luttinger gauge field [38, 39, 57–63] and calculate ˆρ(k, t) using the quan- tum Liouville equation (see Sec. S1 of Supplementary material (SM) [64]). In linear response, we express TSM and TSC as δSγ(ω) =∇aT T\u0002 χγ;a(ω)e−iωt+ c.c.\u0003 ,(2a) Jγ;a(ω) =∇bT Th σγ;ab(ω)e−iωt+ c.c.i ,(2b) whereχγ;a(ω) is the TSM susceptibility tensor and σγ;ab(ω) is the TSC conductivity tensor. Here, the re- peated indices are summed over. We calculate TSM and TSC using Eq. (1) up to linear order inE T, as discussed in Sec. S2 of SM [64]. The TSM susceptibility naturally decomposes asχγ;a=χγ;a Surf+χγ;a Sea, with χγ;a Surf(ω) =1 2X n,k˜εnksγ nnva nn∂fn ∂εnk1 1/τ−iω,(3) χγ;a Sea(ω) =1 2ℏX n̸=p,kQγ;a np(˜εnkfn−˜εpkfp) ωnp1 1 τ−i[ω−ω np]. Here,ω np= (ε nk−εpk)/ℏ,va nn= (1/ℏ)∂ε nk/∂ka, and ˜εn=εnk−µ. This decomposition highlights two distinct geometric origins: the intraband Fermi-surface term and the interband Fermi-sea term. The interband term,χ Sea, reflects a Fermi-sea contribution that survives even in in- sulators.

These results establish a unified framework for finite- frequency thermal spin responses of Bloch electrons rooted in spin band geometry. The framework applies broadly across materials and symmetry classes, includ- ing insulators and nonmagnetic systems, where such re- sponses have so far remained largely unexplored. Symmetry constraints:–With the general formalism of TSM and TSC in place, we next analyze how fundamen- tal and crystalline symmetries constrain these response tensors. This is crucial for identifying material platforms where TSM and TSC can manifest. From Eqs. (3, 5, & 6), 3 it is clear that TSM and TSC originate from the band ge- ometric quantitiesV,U,G, and Ω. These quantities dis- play distinct transformation properties under fundamen- tal symmetries:Vγ;a npis even under time reversal but odd under inversion, whereasUγ;a npis odd under both opera- tions. Similarly,Gγ;ab pnis even under inversion but changes sign under time reversal, whereas Ωγ;ab pnis even under both inversion and time reversal operations (see Sec. S2 of the SM for more details [64]). These contrasting sym- metry properties ensure that TSM and TSC inherit both T-odd andT-even components. TheT-odd responses vanish in non-magnetic systems, whileT-even compo- nents remain finite in both magnetic and non-magnetic systems. In Sec. S3 of SM [64], we provide the explicit expressions for theT-even andT-odd components of fi- nite frequency TSM and TSC responses. Table I lists the T-even andT-odd components for both responses in the d.c.limit.

This decomposition in Table I reveals a ther- modynamic surprise.T-odd TSM andT-even TSC are intrinsic thermal spin responses, which arise purely from the interplay of the Fermi sea and spin band geometry, analogous to the anomalous Hall effect for charge flow. To analyze the impact of crystalline symmetries, we follow Neumann’s principle. It states that if a crystal is invariant under a certain set of symmetry operations, its physical response tensors must also remain invariant under the same operations. A general response tensor Pijk...transforms under a symmetry operationOas [67– 73] Pi′j′k′...=ηTηROi′iOj′jOk′k···Pijk...,(8) wherei, j, k, . . .are spatial indices. The factorη Requals +1 for polar tensors and det(O) for axial tensors. The factorη Tcaptures the effect of time reversal.η T=−1 forT-odd tensors under operationsOinvolvingTand ηT= +1 otherwise [73]. The symmetry-imposed condi- tionPi′j′k′...=Pijk...ensures that only certain tensor components remain nonzero under a given symmetry op- erationO. In our case, TSM responseχγ;ais a rank-2 axial tensor while TSC responseσγ;abis a rank-3 axial tensor, since both carry an odd number of axial indices. Further details of the symmetry analysis are presented in Sec. S3 of the SM [64]. In Table II, we summarize the symmetry-allowed in- dependent components ofχγ;aandσγ;abacross the 32 non-magnetic crystallographic point groups, assuming a thermal gradient in thexyplane. This systematic classi- fication in Table II and extended in Sec. S3 of the SM [64] to include finite-frequency responses across all magnetic point groups, lays the foundation for a systematic search of materials hosting these responses. To substantiate our theoretical predictions in realistic and experimentally accessible materials, we investigate T-even thermal spin responses in non-magnetic RhGe andT-odd responses in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs inTABLE II.Classification of thermal spin responses: List of symmetry-allowed TSM and TSC responses for all 32 non-magnetic crystallographic point groups, assuming a ther- mal gradient in thexyplane. In non-magnetic systems, only T-even responses are allowed, which correspond to an extrin- sic Fermi surface contribution to TSM, and an intrinsic Fermi sea component in TSC.

TSM and TSC inT-symmetric RhGe:-We show time-reversal symmetric thermal spin responses in the non-magnetic Kramers–Weyl metal RhGe using first- principles calculations. RhGe crystallizes in a B20- type chiral cubic structure [Fig. 2(a)], corresponding to the non-centrosymmetric space group P2 13 (point group 23) [74, 75]. Sublattice displacements in RhGe along the [111] direction dimerize atomic bonds and break inversion and roto-inversion symmetries while preserving threefold rotational symmetry (C 3) along the same axis. Our sym- metry classification in Table II shows that RhGe permits finite TSM response componentsχx;xandχy;y, along with TSC response componentsσz;xy,σz;yx,σx;zy, and σy;zx.

The electronic band structure, shown in Fig. 2(b), agrees with previous report [76] (see Sec. S4 of the SM for computational details [64]). The presence of time- reversal symmetry in RhGe enforces double degeneracy of bands at high-symmetry points such as Γ andR, which act as hotspots for band-geometric quantities. This is evident in Fig. 2(c), which shows the momentum-space distribution of anomalous spin polarizability (Ux;x) and spin Berry curvature (Ωx;zy) for the third band in the kz= 0 plane around the Γ point. Figure 2(d) shows the chemical potential (µ) depen- dence of finiteT-even responsesχx;xandσx;zyatT= 100 K. AsUx;xisT-odd, the corresponding Fermi-sea response vanishes inT-symmetric RhGe.

(d) Dependence of the thermal spin magnetization and thermal spin conductivity components on chemical potential. In both responses, only theT-even contributions are finite, which correspond to extrinsic Fermi surface response in magnetization, and intrinsic Fermi sea response in current. Ωx;zy, being aT-even quantity, generates a finite Fermi sea contribution to TSC. Quantitatively, the bulk TSM susceptibility reaches∼10−2µB/˚A2, while TSC conduc- tivity can be as large as∼5ℏ/2e µA/ ˚A. These results establish non-magnetic RhGe as a promising material for realizing sizableT-even TSM and TSC responses. TSM and TSC inT-broken CuMnAs:-To further demonstrate sizable TSM and TSC responses in time- reversal broken (T-odd) systems, we consider the topo- logical antiferromagnet CuMnAs. In CuMnAs, collinear magnetic sublattices connected byPTsymmetry cancel the net atomic magnetization, so the thermally induced itinerant spin magnetization dominates the response. We employ a minimal model of tetragonal CuMnAs on a crinkled quasi-2D square lattice with a collinear anti- ferromagnetic state [77, 78], detailed in Sec. S5 of the SM [64]. The N´ eel vector lies in thexyplane, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Tetragonal CuMnAs belongs to the point groupmmm′(same asm′mmwith crystallographic axes rotated), which hosts the combinedPT,Cz 2,M x, and Mysymmetries, while breaking individualPandTsym- metries. Figure 3(b) shows the band structure (doubly degenerate due toPTsymmetry) for different orienta- tions of the N´ eel vector in thexyplane. Forϕ= 0 and π/2, Dirac cones form along the XM and YM′paths of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Figures 3(c) and (d) highlight enhanced band-geometric quantities near these Dirac points (forϕ= 0).

Together, these findings demonstrate that bothT- symmetric RhGe andT-broken CuMnAs support signifi- cant TSM and TSC responses, establishing them as good candidates for thermo-spintronic applications. Further- more, our analysis of a magnetized Rashba 2DEG (see Sec S6 of the SM [64]) confirms that spin band geometry can produce sizable TSM and TSC responses near band edges, even in simple two-band systems. Experimental implications:–Our predictions for band- geometry-driven TSM and TSC are experimentally ac- cessible. In RhGe, the intrinsic TSC can be detected via the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in a RhGe/Pt bi- layer, where a temperature gradient along theydrives anx-polarized spin current flowing alongz. For a real- istic thermal gradient of∇ yT= 1 K/µmatT= 100 K, readily achievable via Peltier elements or focused laser heating [13, 79], we estimate sizable intrinsic spin current densityJx;z∼5.5×108ℏ/2eA/m2[see Fig. 2(d)] [80]. Injected into a heavy metal such as Pt, the spin cur- rent produces an electric field via ISHE, which can be measured using lock-in techniques [13, 29]. In a ferro- magnet, the same spin current generates a spin torque corresponding to an effective fieldB eff∼0.1 mT for 5 (b) (a) FIG. 3.TSM and TSC in topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs:(a) Unit cell and rectangular Brillouin zone of CuMnAs.

In par- allel, the TSM response can be probed optically via the polar Kerr effect [83–85], particularly for energies where the spin susceptibilityχx;xexhibits sharp features corre- sponding to band crossings [Fig. 2(c)]. With the same amount of thermal field, RhGe generates a peak spin magnetization ofδSx≈0.4×10−5µB/nm3. For CuMnAs, the TSC reachesJz;x∼1.2× 10−2ℏ/2eA/m [see Fig. 3(f)] underE T= 0.01µm−1ˆ x. For the lattice constant ofc= 6.32 ˚A [86, 87], this corresponds to a 3D current density ofJz;x∼0.19× 108ℏ/2eA/m2and is comparable to the TSC in RhGe. The 2D spin susceptibility peaks atχz;x∼2.4× 10−2µB/˚A. This corresponds to a spin magnetization ofδSz∼2.4×10−6µB/nm2which is equivalent to a 3D magnetization ofδSz∼0.38×10−5µB/nm3. These estimates demonstrate that thermal spin responses are systematically enhanced near Dirac crossings and band- geometric hotspots, providing an experimentally acces- sible probe of spin quantum geometric contributions to thermal spin responses.

    "geometric contributions to thermal spin responses. Conclusion:–Our results establish a unified spin band- geometric framework for TSM and TSC responses in itin- erant electronic systems, addressing a long-standing gap in the field. We identify the spin-velocity metric ten- sor and spin geometric tensor as the key band-geometric quantities governing these responses, providing a directanalogue to Berry curvature and quantum metric in charge transport. This framework reveals that thermal spin responses can be sizable even in non-magnetic sys- tems, broadening spin-caloritronic functionalities beyond conventional magnets. Our first-principles and model calculations on RhGe and CuMnAs illustrate how spin band-geometric quan- tities drive sizable thermal spin responses. In RhGe, symmetry-allowed tensor components enhance TSM and TSC near band crossings, while in CuMnAs, thePT symmetry only allows Fermi-sea terms. Our systematic symmetry classification of response tensors provides a roadmap for discovering new material platforms. These insights deepen the understanding of thermal spin trans- port and open new opportunities. Thermally driven spin signals, detectable optically or electrically, can be har- nessed for switching, memory, and information process- ing in nanoscale devices.
