    "LLaVA-OneVision-1.5: Fully Open Framework for Democratized Multimodal Training LLaVA-OneVision Community Contributors Abstract We present LLaVA-OneVision-1.5, a novel family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that achieve state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational and financial costs. Different from the existing works, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 provides an open, efficient, and reproducible framework for building high-quality vision-language models entirely from scratch. The LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 release comprises three primary components:(1) Large-Scale Curated Datasets:We construct an 85M concept-balanced pretraining dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid- Traning and a meticulously curated 22M instruction dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct.(2) Efficient Training Framework:We develop a complete end-to-end efficient training framework leveraginganofflineparalleldatapackingstrategytofacilitatethetrainingofLLaVA-OneVision-1.5 within a$16,000budget.(3) State-of-the-art Performance:Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 yields exceptionally competitive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks. Specifically, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on 18 of 27 benchmarks, and LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-4B surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-3B on all 27 benchmarks. We anticipate releasing LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-RL shortly and encourage the community to await further updates.

These developments enable artificial intelligence applications to effectively comprehend and analyze images, charts, and PDF documents. However, the most performant modelsremainproprietary, withneithertheirtrainingdatanorsourcecodepubliclyavailable. Con- sequently, the broader research community lacks crucial insights into how such high-performing LMMs can be built from scratch. To reduce barriers for community development, several research efforts have attempted to re- produce the capabilities of proprietary models using open architectures. Early efforts such as LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023), LLaVA-Next (Liu et al., 2024b), and LLaVA-OneVision (Li et al., 2025a) provided fully open training data and code, but their performance now falls substantially behind that of current state-of-the-art models (Bai et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025). More recent works have pushed the boundary: Molmo (Deitke et al., 2025) released model weights, datasets, and source code, enabling the community to train LMMs from scratch. Through careful architectural choices, a refined training pipeline, and high-quality data, Molmo achieves near-parity with GPT- 4V on both academic benchmarks and user preference evaluations. Open-Qwen2VL (Wang et al., 2025) introduces a 2B-parameter model pre-trained on only 0.36% of 1.4T multimodal tokens in Qwen2-VL, while outperforming Qwen2-VL-2B across various multimodal benchmarks. Despite these advances, the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models continues to widen as the field of LMMs rapidly evolves. Current open-source models are still constrained by substantial computational demands and suboptimal training efficiency. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce LLaVA-OneVision-1.5, a fully open- source family of LMMs, extending the LLaVA series (Li et al., 2025a) to achieve superior perfor- mance with limited computational cost. Specifically, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 adopts RICE-ViT (Xie et al., 2025) as the vision encoder, enabling native-resolution adaptation and fine-grained visual understanding based on stronger region-level semantic representation. Building upon LLaVA- OneVision (Li et al., 2025a), LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 adopts a three-stage training pipeline: (Stage-1) Language-Image Alignment, (Stage-1.5) High-Quality Knowledge Learning, and (Stage-2) Visual Instruction Tuning. Notably, we find that simply scaling data at the mid-training stage alone can produce state-of-the-art LMMs, eliminating",

To foster open research, we release all assets to the community, including LLaVA-OneVision-1.5- Mid-Traning and LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct datasets, the training framework, and model checkpoints (LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Base and LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct).

LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 retains the “ViT–MLP–LLM” paradigm of the LLaVA series, comprising three core modules: •Vision Encoder: The vision encoder is responsible for extracting rich and semantically meaningful visual representations from input images, which serve as the foundation for multimodal alignment and downstream reasoning. Unlike previous works (Wang et al., 2024b; Bai et al., 2025) that adopt SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) or DFN (Fang et al., 2023), LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 integrates our recently proposed cluster discrimination model RICE- ViT (Xie et al., 2025) to improve region-aware visual and OCR capabilities. •Projector: The projector bridges the modality gap between the vision encoder and the large language model by mapping visual embeddings into the text embedding space of the LLM. Following Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025), we first group spatially adjacent sets of four patch features, which are then concatenated and passed through a two-layer multi-layer perceptron to map them into the text embedding space of the LLM. 3 •Large Language Model: The large language model acts as the reasoning and generation core of the architecture. After receiving the projected multimodal embeddings, the LLM integrates visual information with linguistic context to perform complex reasoning, instruc- tion following, and natural language generation. The LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 series utilize Qwen3 (Team, 2025) as the language backbone to significantly enhance performance on downstream tasks. This modular design follows the LLaVA framework but incorporates more efficient training recipes and carefully selected encoders, enabling superior cost-effectiveness and scalability. 2.2 Vision Encoder via Region-Aware Cluster Discrimination Fine-grained visual semantics are essential for dense prediction tasks such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation.

This modular design follows the LLaVA framework but incorporates more efficient training recipes and carefully selected encoders, enabling superior cost-effectiveness and scalability. 2.2 Vision Encoder via Region-Aware Cluster Discrimination Fine-grained visual semantics are essential for dense prediction tasks such as grounding, OCR, and segmentation. Although large-scale vision–language contrastive models like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) demonstrate strong performance through global vision- language alignment, they fail to capture the similarity structure of training data or the local region- level semantics within images. This shortcoming stems from instance-wise contrastive learning, which treats all instances as negatives regardless of their semantic similarity and represents each instance solely with a single global embedding. Toovercometheselimitations,ourLLaVA-OneVision-1.5leveragestheRICE-ViT(Xieetal.,2025)as itsvisionencoder, enablingprecisemultimodalalignmentandenrichedregion-levelrepresentation. RICE-ViT enhances both object-centric and OCR capabilities by introducing a unified region cluster discrimination loss, trained on 450M images and 2.4B candidate regions. Its design combines a region-awareattentionmechanismforlocalsemanticmodelingwith2Drotarypositionalencoding, which naturally supports variable input resolutions without requiring resolution-specific fine- tuning, unlike models such as Qwen2-VL (Wang et al., 2024b) and InternVL 2.5 (Chen et al., 2024b). We integrate this pretrained encoder with a language model through joint training, yielding a streamlined multimodal pipeline. Compared to SigLIP2 (Tschannen et al., 2025), which depends on multiple specialized losses (SILC, TIPS, LocCa, and Sigmoid), our method adopts a single cluster discrimination loss that simultaneously strengthens general understanding, OCR, and localization. This unified formulation provides an elegant, computationally efficient solution that matches SigLIP2’s performance while substantially reducing architectural complexity and training overhead. 3 Data 3.1 Pre-Training Dataset We use the LLaVA-1.5 558K (Liu et al., 2024a) to align the visual features into the word embedding spaceofLLMs. Afterthat, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5isunderpinnedbyalarge-scalemultimodaldataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning, which contains 85 million high-quality image-text pairs (20M in Chinese and 65M in English). The data of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning are from a wide range of sources: COYO-700M (Byeon et al., 2022), Obelics (Laurençon et al., 2023), DataComp- 1B (Gadre et al., 2023), LAION-CN (Zhang et al., 2022), ImageNet-21K (Russakovsky et al., 2015), SAM-1B (Kirillov et al., 2023), MINT (Wang et al., 2024c), and Zero250M (Xie et al., 2023). To enrich the diversity of our pretraining data, we introduce a concept-balanced sampling strategy inspired by MetaCLIP (Xu et al., 2024). Unlike MetaCLIP, which depends on raw captions for concept matching and struggles with caption-free or interleaved datasets (e.g., SAM-1B, ImageNet- 4 (a) (b) (c) Figure 3(a) The vocabulary coverage proportion in the LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning dataset before and after concept balancing.

Instead, we adopt a feature-based matching approach that coarsely groups image sources. Specifically, using the pretrained MetaCLIP-H/14-Full-CC2.5B encoders (Xu et al., 2024), we project both images and MetaCLIP’s 500K concept entries into a shared embedding space. Since MetaCLIP embeddings are already concept-balanced, this enables effective similarity-based concept induction: for each image, we retrieve its top-K nearest concept embeddings to construct refined pseudo-captions that enhance semantic alignment.

    "Since MetaCLIP embeddings are already concept-balanced, this enables effective similarity-based concept induction: for each image, we retrieve its top-K nearest concept embeddings to construct refined pseudo-captions that enhance semantic alignment. Top-K Concept Assignment and Balance Sampling.Given an image set ℐ={𝑖 0, 𝑖1, ..., 𝑖 𝑁}and a concept vocabulary set 𝒱={𝑣 0, 𝑣1, ...𝑣 𝑀}, we first utilize the image encoder Φ𝑣and text encoder Φ𝑡to extract the image embeddings ℰ𝑖={Φ 𝑣(︀𝑖)︀, 𝑖∈𝐼} and concept embeddings ℰ𝑡={Φ 𝑡(︀𝑣)︀, 𝑣∈𝑉} . Then we assign each image with the top- 𝑘nearest concepts based on the cosine similarity of the L2-normalized image and concept embeddings. After that, following MetaCLIP (Xu et al., 2024), we weight each image by the inverse frequencies of its concepts and then sample images based on the normalized image weights. This inverse-frequency methodology promotes a more balanced concept distribution, without relying on original captions, which may be noisy or missing. This process yields 85M images with balanced concepts. Subsequently, we apply a powerful captioner to produce English and Chinese captions for these images, followed by a validity filter to eliminate duplicates and excessively lengthy outputs. Ultimately, we establish an 85M concept-balanced mid-training dataset. The distribution of data sources of the LLaVA- OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning dataset is illustrated in Fig. 3(b). 3.2 Instruction Dataset Visual instruction tuning (Liu et al., 2023) is vital for enabling LMMs to understand and follow visual instructions, and its effectiveness hinges on the quality of the instruction datasets. To this end, we construct the LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct dataset by aggregating a wide range of instruction-tuning datasets from diverse sources. The data are carefully curated to ensure balanced coverage across seven categories: Caption, Chart & Table, Code & Math, Domain-specific, General VQA, Grounding & Counting, OCR, and Science. The resulting corpus comprises 22 million samples, with Fig. 3(c) showing the proportional distribution across categories. 5 Table 1Performance comparison across vision-language models on various benchmarks grouped by task type.

This results in significant computational overhead and poor GPU utilization, particularly with heterogeneous multimodal data. To mitigate this, we propose an offline parallel data packing method that consolidates multiple shorter samples into packed sequences during preprocessing. Our approach employs hash buckets to handle large-scale data efficiently and leverages multi-threaded, strategy-aware batching to control packing success rate, sample count, and batch composition. Unlike online packing, which operates dynamically at runtime, our method processes entire datasets or large contiguous chunks offline, ensuring uniform output lengths. This yields up to an 11×compression ratio on 85 million pretraining samples, substantially improving efficiency.

Its transformer engine and specialized optimizations enable efficient mid-training of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B with a context length of 8K. By lever- aging distributed optimizer parallelism and uniform recomputation, the mid-training process is conducted at native resolution on 85 million captions using 128×A800 GPUs over 3.7 days. 5 Experiments 5.1 Overall Performance We use LMMs-Eval Zhang et al.

To thoroughly evaluate these capabilities, we assess LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 across seven challenging benchmarks. LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B demonstrates robust outcomes on ChartQA (86.5), CharXiv DQ(74.1), DocVQA (95.0), AI2D w M (84.2), and AI2D w/o M(94.1). Notably, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-4B outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on all seven benchmarks. 5.5 Others To further elucidate the capabilities of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5, we extend our evaluation to in- clude PixmoCount, CountBench, VL-RewardBench, and V*. LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B records scores of 62.2 on PixmoCount, 88.2 on CountBench, 46.7 on VL-RewardBench, and 78.0 on V*, demonstrating proficiency in counting, visual perception, and visual grounding, on par with Qwen2.5-VL-7B. 8 Figure4Performancecomparisonacrossdifferentmid-trainingdatascalesonvariousbenchmarks.

Figure 5Experimental results using 2M blanced and unbalanced mid-training samples (LLaVA- NeXT-780k as the SFT data) show that using a balanced mid-training dataset yields consistent improvements over a random sampling strategy. 5.6 Ablation Study 5.6.1 Comparison of Different Vision Encoders InTab.2, weevaluatevariousvisionencoders, CLIP(Radfordetal.,2021), MLCD(Anetal.,2024), AIMv2 (Fini et al., 2025), DFN (Fang et al., 2023), SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023), SigLIPv2 (Tschannen etal.,2025), andRICE-ViT(Xieetal.,2025), withintheLLaVA-NeXTframework. Ataresolutionof 336 pixels, RICE-ViT surpasses CLIP across all benchmarks, achieving significant gains in InfoVQA (+6.3%) and OCRBench (+5.0%). It also demonstrates significant improvements in document understandingcomparedtoAIMv2. At378pixels,RICE-ViToutperformscomputationallyintensive models such as SigLIPv2 in 9 of 14 benchmarks, notably in InfoVQA (+4.4%), DocVQA (+3.5%), andChartQA(+4.9%). TheseresultspositionRICE-ViTasaleadingvisionencoder,enhancingOCR capabilities and providing robust visual understanding, crucial for applications requiring advanced document analysis and visual reasoning. In addition, we further compare the performance of RICE-ViT with that of Qwen-ViT after incorporating LMM training, where RICE-ViT is derived from LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-3B and Qwen-ViT is derived from Qwen2.5-VL-7B. In the areas of OCR & Document Understanding and General Vision Understanding, RICE-ViT demonstrates average performance improvements of 1.9% and 0.9% compared to Qwen-ViT. 9 Figure6Performancecomparisonofthreedatasets(Merge46M,FineVision,andLLaVA-OneVision- 1.5-Inst-Data) across 16 benchmarks during the SFT phase, demonstrating the superiority of Merge46M on most benchmarks. 5.6.2 Mid-Training Data Scaling As depicted in Fig. 4, we present the performance of three different LMMs trained with various scales of mid-training data across ten distinct benchmarks. Employing LLaVA-558K for language- image alignment and standard LLaVA-Next instruction tuning, our findings indicate that scaling the data volume during the high-quality knowledge learning phase consistently enhances model performance across all benchmarks. These results not only underscore the high quality and scalability of the proposed LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning dataset but also confirm the efficacy of data scaling in improving the performance of LMMs. 5.6.3 Effectiveness of Concept Balance Fig. 3(a) illustrates that after implementing concept balancing, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning exhibits a smoother distribution, thereby enhancing the model’s capability to assimilate a more comprehensive set of knowledge. To further validate the effect of concept balance, we conducted a comparative analysis of models trained on 2M concept-balanced data versus those trained on 10 2M data obtained through random sampling. As indicated in Fig. 5, the concept-balanced 2M data set demonstrates superior performance in 25 of 27 evaluated downstream benchmarks. 5.6.4 Instruction Data Quality and Scaling To enhance performance across diverse VQA tasks, we compile 124 types of instruction data (LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Inst-Data) for SFT training. We further scale the model capabilities by deduplicating and merging the recently proposed FineVision dataset (HuggingFaceM4, 2025), resulting in the Merged46M SFT dataset. To maintain consistent training steps, we double the batch size for Merged46M due to its larger scale. Fig. 6 shows performance comparisons on 16 benchmarks during SFT using three datasets: LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Inst-Data, FineVision, and Merged46M. LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Inst-Data achieves performance comparable to FineVision, while the Merged46M dataset delivers the best results across nearly all benchmarks. 6 Conclusions In this work, we introduce LLaVA-OneVision-1.5,",

LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Inst-Data achieves performance comparable to FineVision, while the Merged46M dataset delivers the best results across nearly all benchmarks. 6 Conclusions In this work, we introduce LLaVA-OneVision-1.5, a family of large multimodal models that estab- lishes a new paradigm for constructing high-performance vision-language systems with improved efficiency and reproducibility. We demonstrate the feasibility of training competitive multimodal models from scratch under strict constraints. Our contributions are threefold: a large-scale, curated multimodal dataset; an efficient end-to-end training framework operable under a limited budget; and extensive empirical results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. The model excels particularly in resource-constrained settings, surpassing strong baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL-7B. This study underscores how open and efficient frameworks can drive progress in multimodal AI, democratizing access to state-of-the-art performance. We envision LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 as a foundational resource that empowers the community to build specialized applications and develop more powerful LMMs across diverse tasks through continued scaling.
