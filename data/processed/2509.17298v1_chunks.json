    "Efficient Measurement Error Mitigation with Subsystem-Balanced Pauli Twirling Xiao-Yue Xu,1Chen Ding,1and Wan-Su Bao1,∗ 1Henan Key Laboratory of Quantum Information and Cryptography, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, China (Dated: September 23, 2025) Measurement error mitigation (MEM) is essential for realizing reliable quantum computation. Model- free measurement error mitigation (MF-MEM) is an important class of MEM methods that employs Pauli twirling—typically with a random twirling set—to convert measurement noise into a state-independent scaling factor, thereby enabling error mitigation through simple calibration. However, such methods face prohibitive sampling overhead, limiting their scalability. To address this, we introduce subsystem-balanced Pauli twirling (SB-PT), a twirling method designed for MF-MEM that enforces Pauli operator balance on measuring sub- systems to selectively suppress dominant measurement noise. Theoretically, for a weight-τPauli observable, SB-PT removes all independent error components using onlyO(4τ)random circuits, substantially reducing the sampling overhead over conventional Pauli twirling. This efficiency gain is most significant for sparse observ- ables. To extend such resource-efficient mitigation to arbitrary observables, we develop a hardware-efficient measurement transformation framework that converts high-weight Pauli operators into low-weight effective ones via linear-depth circuits. The circuit noise introduced during this transformation is jointly mitigated with native measurement noise using a unified twirling protocol, ensuring robust performance. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate a greater than 16-fold improvement in sampling efficiency over conventional random twirling, with consistent performance gains across varying system sizes and error regimes. This work provides a resource-frugal and experimentally viable path toward high-fidelity measurement in near-term quantum devices. I. INTRODUCTION Quantum computers hold significant potential for solv- ing classically intractable problems across a wide range of fields, including quantum chemistry, optimization, and ma- chine learning [1–3], yet are fundamentally limited by hard- ware imperfections. Among these, measurement errors pose a particularly critical challenge: they systematically corrupt the final readout after quantum state collapse, irreversibly de- stroying computational results. Crucially, the dimensionality of measurement noise scales exponentially with qubit number, requiringO(4n)parameters for full characterization, rapidly becoming infeasible for practical devices. This exponential barrier motivates simplified error models. The most direct approach leverages measurement’s projective nature, treating readout errors as classical state transitions af- ter state collapse [4–8]. We model them through a stochastic map with transfer matrixΛrelating ideal (p ideal) and noisy (pnoisy) distributions via pideal= Λ−1pnoisy.(1) Quantum mechanically, this corresponds to a quantum chan- nelN=E Λ◦ Dwhere the complete dephasing channel D(ρ) =P k⟨k|ρ|k⟩|k⟩⟨k|eliminates coherence, followed by the population noise channelE Λ(σ) =P i(P j[Λ]ijσj)|i⟩⟨i| for the resulting diagonal stateσ=P jσj|j⟩⟨j|withσ j= ⟨j|σ|j⟩, which modifies the diagonal elements according to the transfer matrixΛ. However, even this classical reduction remains exponentially costly as it requiresO(2n)parameters, motivating further simplification. The Tensor Product Noise (TPN) model [5, 9–11] assumes qubit-independent measure- ment noise, which implies a transfer matrix that factorizes as ∗bws@qiclab.cnΛTPN=Nn i=1Λi. This reduces the complexity toO(n), mak- ing mitigation tractable for large systems, though at the cost of neglecting correlated and quantum coherent errors. An alternative paradigm is model-free measurement er- ror mitigation (MF-MEM) [12–16], which circumvents model-dependent limitations.

    "tractable for large systems, though at the cost of neglecting correlated and quantum coherent errors. An alternative paradigm is model-free measurement er- ror mitigation (MF-MEM) [12–16], which circumvents model-dependent limitations. This method employs Pauli twirling [17–20] to tailor the full measurement noise channel into a Pauli form, enabling its mitigation via state-independent rescaling without requiring explicit characterization. While effective for moderate-scale systems [21], the conventional approach using undirected random twirling becomes pro- hibitively resource-intensive at scale. Motivated by tailored twirling techniques that construct minimal twirling sets for specific error channels [22], we in- troduce Subsystem-Balanced Pauli Twirling (SB-PT) for MF- MEM. SB-PT systematically exploits the structure of mea- surement noise by designing twirling sets in which each Pauli operator is balanced on the measured subsystems, thereby se- lectively suppressing the dominant independent error com- ponents. We rigorously prove that for any Pauli observ- able of weightτ < n, SB-PT requires onlyO(4τ)random circuits to exactly cancel all independent measurement er- rors, while also delivering strictly tighter sampling overhead bounds than conventional random twirling. To extend these advantages beyond sparse observables, we integrate a mea- surement transformation protocol that generalizes Compres- sion Readout [23, 24]; this protocol converts anym-weight Pauli observable intok-weight form (k≤m) viaO(n)- depth circuits while maintaining compatibility with twirling. This framework incorporates both measurement noise and circuit-induced noise into a unified effective noise model, en- abling unified error mitigation. Numerical simulations con- firm these advantages across multiple noise regimes and ob- servable types, demonstrating significantly improved resource efficiency over MF-MEM with random twirling while main- taining comparable fidelity.arXiv:2509.17298v1 [quant-ph] 22 Sep 2025 2 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec- tion II establishes the theoretical foundation, introducing the Pauli-transfer-matrix representation and the MF-MEM frame- work. This prepares the essential formalism for our approach. In Section III, we develop the SB-PT protocol: we first char- acterize the algebraic structure of classical measurement noise within the Pauli-transfer-matrix representation, then construct the SB-PT method by exploiting the inherent symmetries. Section IV addresses mitigation scalability through measure- ment transformation techniques, enabling efficient SB-PT im- plementation for high-weight observables. Comprehensive numerical simulations validating our protocol under various noise regimes are presented in Section V. Finally, we con- clude with discussions on broader implications and potential extensions. II. TWIRLING-BASED MEASUREMENT ERROR MITIGATION A. The Pauli-Transfer-Matrix formalism Measurement noise systematically corrupts the expecta- tion values of Pauli observables by introducing non-physical shifts. To establish this formally, we adopt the Pauli-transfer- matrix (PTM) representation [25, 26]. Within this formal- ism, the quantum stateρis encoded as the column vec- tor|ρ⟩⟩, while the quantum channelE—completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) [1] map—corresponds to a real ma- trixM Eacting on the vector. The observableOmaps to row vector⟨⟨O|in the same basis. The expectation value⟨O⟩of an observableO, given that the stateρhas evolved under the channelE, is given by the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: ⟨O⟩=Tr(OE(ρ)) =⟨⟨O|M E|ρ⟩⟩.(2) We order then-qubit Pauli group{I, X, Y, Z}⊗nby as- signing to each indexp∈ {0,1, ...,4n−1}the unique Pauli operatorP p=Nn i=1σpi, whereσ 0=I,σ 1=X,σ 2=Y, σ3=Zandp= (p 1,p2, ...,p n)∈Zn 4is the base-4 rep- resentation of the numberp, where",
    "the channelE, is given by the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: ⟨O⟩=Tr(OE(ρ)) =⟨⟨O|M E|ρ⟩⟩.(2) We order then-qubit Pauli group{I, X, Y, Z}⊗nby as- signing to each indexp∈ {0,1, ...,4n−1}the unique Pauli operatorP p=Nn i=1σpi, whereσ 0=I,σ 1=X,σ 2=Y, σ3=Zandp= (p 1,p2, ...,p n)∈Zn 4is the base-4 rep- resentation of the numberp, where eachp iis a digit ofp. Likewise, the subgroup{I, Z}⊗nis ordered by an analogous binary map that assigns to each indexr∈ {0,1, ...,2n−1}the operatorZ r=Nn i=1σri, wherer∈Zn 2andσ 0=I,σ 1=Z. To embed the subgroup{I, Z}⊗ninto the fulln-qubit Pauli group, we introduce the index-preserving maps: ϕ:{0,1, . . . ,2n−1} → {0,1, . . . ,4n−1}, ˜ϕ:Zn 2→Zn 4,(3) where we flip every1inZn 2to3inZn 4. Formally, ˜ϕ(r) = (3r 1, . . . ,3r n)∈Zn 4, ϕ(r) =nX i=13ri4i−1.(4) This construction ensures thatZ r=Pϕ(r)for allr.The matrix element ofM Eis defined for indicesp, q∈ {0,1, ...,4n−1}as [ME]pq=1 2nTr(P pE(Pq)).(5) In particular, any Pauli observableP qcan be repre- sented by the standard-basis row vector⟨⟨P q|=eT q= (0, . . . ,1, . . . ,0)Tin the PTM representation, wheree qhas a single nonzero entry (1 at indexqcorresponding to the po- sition ofP qin the Pauli basis). B. Model-free measurement error mitigation via Pauli twirling We now formalize the impact of measurement noise on expectation-value estimation for Pauli observables and intro- duce the foundational principles of MF-MEM. Without loss of generality, we describe our protocol using Pauli-Zobserv- ables, as single-qubit Cliffords can map any Pauli observable to this form. For general measurement noiseRwithin the PTM representation, the noisy expectation value for Pauli-Z observableZ ris ⟨˜Zr⟩ρ=⟨⟨Z r|R|ρ⟩⟩= 2n4n−1X j=0[R]ϕ(r)j·ϱj(ρ),(6) whereϱ j(ρ)is thej-th element of|ρ⟩⟩, which equals the scaled noiseless expectation value⟨⟨P j|ρ⟩⟩=1 2nTr(ρP j). The measurement noiseRresults in additional systematic bias of the ideal valueϱ ϕ(r)(ρ). MF-MEM methods exploits Pauli twirling to convert the measurement noise channelRinto stochastic Pauli channel, enabling bias correction. For a randomly chosen twirling set S(a subset of then-qubit Pauli group with|S| ≤4n), the twirled noise channel is Rtwirled=1 |S|X Pq∈SPqRPq,(7) whereP qis the PTM of Pauli operatorP q, a diagonal matrix with element[P q]ii=η(P q, Pi)fori∈ {0,1, ...,4n−1}. Hereη(P q, Pi) =±1denotes the commutator sign satisfy- ingP qPiP† q=η(P q, Pi)Pi. The latterP qis virtually ap- plied through post-processing of the measurement outcomes. Specifically, when the Pauli term on a single qubit isXor Y, this virtual application is achieved by bit-flipping the mea- surement outcomes (0 and 1). The PTM elements of the twirled channel simplify to [Rtwirled]ij=1 |S|X Pq∈Sη(Pq, Pi)η(P q, Pj)[R] ij.(8) Defining the scaling factor: αij(S) =1 |S|X Pq∈Sη(Pq, PiPj),(9) 3 and noting thatη(P q, Pi)η(P q, Pj) =η(P q, PiPj)holds un- der the standard Pauli multiplication convention, we obtain: [Rtwirled]ij=αij(S)[R] ij.(10) Crucially, the diagonal elements remain unchanged since: αii(S) =1 |S|X Pq∈Sη(Pq, PiPi) =1 |S|X Pq∈Sη(Pq, I) = 1, (11) preserving the intrinsic noise characteristics, while off- diagonal elements are scaled byα ij(S), with the scaling mag- nitude determined byS. When employing the full twirling setS={I, X, Y, Z}⊗n, the off-diagonal elements vanish (α ij(S) = 0fori̸=j), re- sulting in a diagonal matrixRtwirled. Consequently, the twirled noisy expectation value",

When employing the full twirling setS={I, X, Y, Z}⊗n, the off-diagonal elements vanish (α ij(S) = 0fori̸=j), re- sulting in a diagonal matrixRtwirled. Consequently, the twirled noisy expectation value forZ r: v(ρ) = 2n4n−1X j=0αϕ(r)j(S)[R] ϕ(r)j·ϱj(ρ)(12) then simplifies to v(ρ) = 2n[R]ϕ(r)ϕ(r) ·ϱj(ρ) = [R] ϕ(r)ϕ(r) ·Tr(ρZ r).(13) This shows that the noisy expectation valuev(ρ)is equal to a scalar multiple of the ideal expectation value⟨Z r⟩ρ= Tr(ρZ r). The multiplicative factorλ= [R] ϕ(r)ϕ(r) depends solely on the measurement noise channelRand is indepen- dent of the stateρ. Since Tr(ρ 0Zr) = 1withρ 0=|0⟩⟨0|⊗n for anyr(as|0⟩⟨0|is a+1eigen-state ofZ), we obtain λ=v(ρ 0). The mitigated expectation value is then given by a(ρ) =v(ρ) v(ρ0)=λ⟨Zr⟩ρ λ=⟨Z r⟩ρ,(14) which exactly recovers the ideal expectation value. However, when a reduced twirling setS(with|S|<4n) is employed, the twirling becomes imperfect. This results in non-vanishing off-diagonal elements, meaningα ϕ(r)j(S)̸= 0 for somej̸=ϕ(r). Consequently, certain noise terms are not fully canceled via Eq. 14, introducing error terms of the form αϕ(r)j(S)[R] ϕ(r)j·ϱj(ρ)intov(ρ). These errors cause the mitigated estimatea(ρ)to deviate from the ideal expectation value. We analyze the estimation error of Eq. (14), formally pre- sented in Theorem 1 (see proof in Appendix A 1). Theorem 1.For anyn-qubit quantum stateρand Pauli-Z observableZ r, with probability at least1−δover the choice of randomS, the estimation errorϵ(ρ) =|a(ρ)−Tr(ρZ r)|is bounded by ϵ(ρ)≤2κ(S)P j̸=ϕ(r)|[R]ϕ(r)j| |[R]ϕ(r)ϕ(r) −κ(S)P j̸=ϕ(r)|[R]ϕ(r)j||,(15) where κ(S) =s 2 |S|(2nln 2 + ln(2/δ)),(16) II IZ ZI ZZ II IZ ZI ZZ II IZ ZI ZZII IZ ZI ZZ(a) (b)FIG. 1.Pauli Transfer Matrix structure for classical measure- ment noise models.To reveal the non-zero patterns more clearly, the heatmaps display the absolute values of the PTM elements.

III. SUBSYSTEM-BALANCED PAULI TWIRLING A. Structure of classical measurement noise model The efficacy of any tailored twirling strategy hinges on a precise understanding of the noise it aims to suppress. Unlike general quantum processes, classical measurement noise ex- hibits a highly constrained algebraic structure. This structure arises because the measurement process projects the quan- tum state into a classical outcome, confining noise effects to a specific subset of elements in the PTM. Furthermore, as",

This structure arises because the measurement process projects the quan- tum state into a classical outcome, confining noise effects to a specific subset of elements in the PTM. Furthermore, as evi- denced by experimental characterizations of superconducting quantum processors [27–29], this noise is not unstructured; it predominantly follows a hierarchical model where local error processes dominate. This characteristic structure motivates the design of twirling sets that target and cancel these domi- nant errors efficiently, rather than treating the noise as a black box. 4 Y ZX I Z I I IPauli-Z observable Twirling gates (a) (b) ZPauli-Z observable Z Z ZMeasurement circuit Y ZITwirling gates IXPost processing 0 1 01 0 1 10Post processing ISubsystem-Balanced Pauli Twirling Subsystem-Balanced Pauli Twirling Measurement transformation Uniform ... ... ... ...

(a) For sparse Pauli observables, we directly apply SB-PT by uniformly sampling Pauli operators within the observable’s support and random Pauli gates on remaining qubits. The first sequence of twirling gates is physically applied; the second is virtually implemented via post process (measurement bit-flips). (b) For high-weight observables, we employ measurement transformation to transform the observable into a sparse Pauli form. Then we apply SB-PT to simultaneously twirl the composite noise originating from both the measurement circuit and the native measurement process. The measurement transformation technology comprises two modalities: weight reduction (converting contiguous Pauli- Zoperators to sparse ones) and location shift (relocating Pauli-Zoperators within the observable). We first introduce thePauli-Zsubset, which consists of in- dex pairs where each pair corresponds to an operator restricted to{I, Z}⊗n. Formally, the Pauli-Zsubset of index pairs is defined as IZ:={(ϕ(r), ϕ(s))|r,s∈Zn 2}.(18) For the PTM element[R] ijwithi, j∈ {0,1, ...,4n−1}, it holds that[R] ij= 0when(i, j)/∈I Z. Then we can define the reduced matrixR Zas the restriction of the full PTMRto this Pauli-ZsubsetI Z, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), which forms a2n×2nmatrix that completely characterizes the classical measurement noise. Forr,s∈Zn 2, the PTM encodes noise statistics through [R]ϕ(r),ϕ(s) = [R Z]r,s=1 2n2n−1X j=0(−1)s·j2n−1X k=0[Λ]kj(−1)r·k, (19) where the dot productr·k=L irikiis computed modulo 2. This expression decomposes physically into measurement- induced dephasing channelDand classical bit-flip noise chan- nelE Λ, as introduced in Eq. 1 and the accompanying text. The termP j(−1)s·jcapturesD, representing wavefunction collapse to computational basis states during measurement. Meanwhile,P k[Λ]kj(−1)r·kcorresponds toE Λ, computingthe expectation value ofZ rafter classical readout errors gov- erned by the transfer matrixΛ. Especially, under the TPN model, spatial independence simplifies the noise structure significantly. The overall PTM factorizes into single-qubit components: RZ=nO k=1R(k) Z,whereR(k) Z=\u0012 1 0 ωkζk\u0013 ,(20) with local parametersω k=ak+bk−1andζ k=ak−bk, wherea k=P(noisy0|ideal0)is the probability of obtain- ing the noisy outcome 0 given the ideal state|0⟩andb k= P(noisy1|ideal1)is the probability of obtaining 1 given the ideal|1⟩.

The constraint|ω k| ≤1− |ζ k|ensures physical realizability. This tensor decomposition imposes a stricttrigger condi- tionthat determines which matrix elements can be non-zero. To characterize this condition, we define the support of a Pauli operatorZ ras supp(Z r) ={k|r k= 1}.(21) Then, an element[R Z]rsofR Zis non-zero if and only if the support ofZ sis contained within that ofZ r: [RZ]rs̸= 0⇐⇒supp(Z s)⊆supp(Z r).(22) 5 Physically, this condition implies that the measurement out- come ofZ scan be affected byZ ronly ifZ ris measured on all qubits included in the measurement ofZ s. The collection of all operator pairs satisfying this support condition defines theTPN subset: T={(r, s)|supp(Z s)⊆supp(Z r)},(23) as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). For any(r, s)∈Tandr̸= 0, the matrix elements decom- pose into physically interpretable factors: [RZ]rs= Y k:sk=1ζk! × Y k:rk=1,s k=0ωk .(24) Here, the first product quantifies bit-flip suppression on qubits measured by both operators, while the second captures the noise contribution from qubits measured byZ rbut not byZ s (See Appendix B for a detailed derivation.). B. Subsystem-balanced pauli twirling tailored for TPN subspace Building upon the TPN subsetTdefined above, we now in- troduce a decomposition of the noise PTMR Zthat separates its elements based on membership inT: RZ=RT Z+RT Z,(25) where the two components are defined as follows: •RT Zconsists of all elements whose indices(r, s)belong toT, i.e.,[RT Z]rs= [R Z]rsif(r, s)∈T, and0other- wise. •RT Zcontains all elements whose indices are in the com- plement set T, i.e.,[RT Z]rs= [R Z]rsif(r, s)/∈T, and 0otherwise. This decomposition isolatesRT Z, which captures all local in- dependent errors conforming to the TPN model, as well as a subset of correlated errors consistent with the TPN support structure. The remaining term,RT Z, contains only correlated errors not captured by the TPN model and is typically weak in magnitude. To specifically target and eliminate the dominant TPN- related errors captured inRT Z, we propose Subsystem- Balanced Pauli Twirling (SB-PT). This method constructs tai- lored twirling sets that are balanced across measured subsys- tems, enabling efficient mitigation of TPN-structured errors without requiring prior noise characterization. By exploiting the spatial locality of target observables, SB-PT significantly reduces the resource overhead compared to conventional ran- dom twirling. The overall structure of MF-MEM combined with SB-PT is illustrated in Fig. 2(a). To realize this tailored twirling strategy, we first character- izes the spatial extent of the target observable. We define theweight of a Pauli-ZoperatorZ ras the number of qubits on which it acts non-trivially: τ(r)≡ |Z r|=|supp(Z r)|=Hamm(r,0),(26) where Hamm(r,0) =Pn i=1ridenotes the Hamming weight of the binary vectorr. This weightτ(r)corresponds to the number of qubits measured. The SB-PT setSsubis constructed via a stratified sampling strategy. We choose the size of the twirling set to|Ssub|= c·4τ(r), wherec≥1is an integer. Each twirling operator Pq∈ Ssubis structured as Pq= O i∈supp(Z r)σqi ⊗ O i′/∈supp(Z r)σqi′ ,(27) where the first tensor factor acts on",
    "the number of qubits measured. The SB-PT setSsubis constructed via a stratified sampling strategy. We choose the size of the twirling set to|Ssub|= c·4τ(r), wherec≥1is an integer. Each twirling operator Pq∈ Ssubis structured as Pq= O i∈supp(Z r)σqi ⊗ O i′/∈supp(Z r)σqi′ ,(27) where the first tensor factor acts on theτ(r)-qubit subsystem whereZ ris supported, and the second acts on the remain- ingn−τ(r)qubits. To ensure balanced twirling over the subsystem, the Pauli terms acting on qubits within supp(Z r) are selected to satisfy the following condition for eachΓ∈ {I, X, Y, Z}: |q:σ qi= Γ| |Ssub|=1 4.(28) This ensures uniform sampling over the four Pauli oper- ators for every qubit in the support. For qubits outside supp(Z r), the operators are chosen uniformly at random from {I, X, Y, Z}. This protocol achieves targeted error suppression by ensur- ing all error components inRT Zacting on supp(Z r)are exactly canceled, as formalized in Theorem 2 (See Appendix A 2 for proof.). Theorem 2.For any Pauli-Z observableZ r, we define the trigger setJ ras a subset of{0, ...,2n−1} \\ {r}where s∈ J r⇔(r, s)∈T.(29) Then for anys∈ J r, the scaling factor of SB-PT twirling set Ssubsatisfy: αϕ(r)ϕ(s) (Ssub) = 0.(30) This induces complete cancellation of all noise components in RT Zacting on supp(Z r). This targeted annihilation within the TPN subset concen- trates resources on suppressing the dominant noise compo- nentRT Z, substantially improving the sampling efficiency for finite-sized twirling sets. As a necessary consequence, noise components outside this subspace—specifically, elements in RT Zand quantum coherent errors—experience weaker sup- pression compared to random twirling. Nevertheless, by in- creasing the integer scaling factorc, our method progressively suppresses these residual components, driving all error terms toward zero while maintaining balanced Pauli sampling over the subsystem. When integrated into the MF-MEM framework, the SB-PT setSsubyields a tighter bound on the estimation error than the general result in Theorem 1, as we establish below in Theo- rem 3 (see Appendix A 3 for the full proof). 6 Theorem 3.We define the extension set asΦ(J r) = {ϕ(s)|s∈ J r} ⊆ {0, ...,4n−1}. For anyn-qubit quantum stateρand Pauli-Z observableZ r, with probability≥1−δ over SB-PT setSsub, the estimation errorϵ(ρ) =|a(ρ)− Tr(ρZ r)|is bounded by: ϵSB-PT(ρ)≤2κSB(Ssub)P j /∈Φ(J r)|[R]ϕ(r)j| |[R]ϕ(r)ϕ(r) | −κ SB(Ssub)P j /∈Φ(J r)|[R]ϕ(r)j| (31) where κSB(Ssub) =s 2 |Ssub|(2mln 2 + ln(2/δ)) m=n−τ(r) =n− |supp(Z r)|(32) under the diagonal dominance condition: |[R]ϕ(r)ϕ(r) |> κ SB(Ssub)X j /∈Φ(J r)|[R]ϕ(r)j|.(33) This establishes an error bound that is strictly less than the one presented in Eq. 15 of Theorem 1. The scaling of our bound withτ(r)complicates direct com- parison across observables of different weights, since the size of the twirling set|Ssub|=c·4τ(r)itself grows with the ob- servable support. Nevertheless, for any fixedτ(r)and fixed twirling set size, our bound is strictly tighter than that of ran- dom twirling (given in Theorem 1), demonstrating the practi- cal benefit of SB-PT under finite sampling. For high-weight observables, however, the performance gap between SB-PT and random twirling narrows, particu- larly when|Ssub|<4τ(r).

For high-weight observables, however, the performance gap between SB-PT and random twirling narrows, particu- larly when|Ssub|<4τ(r). To mitigate this limitation, we next introduce measurement transformation techniques that reduce the effective weight of such observables. Although these tech- niques introduce additional circuit noise, they offer a favor- able trade-off that preserves overall error mitigation perfor- mance, thereby extending the scope of our method to broader classes of observables. IV . MEASUREMENT TRANSFORMATION We propose measurement transformation (MT), a hardware-efficient protocol that converts arbitrary high- weight Pauli-Zobservables into measurement-equivalent low-weight counterparts. The protocol integrates two complementary techniques: • Weight reduction (WR) compresses contiguous Pauli-Z operators into sparse ones [23, 24], reducing the number of non-trivial Pauli terms. • Location shift (LS) spatially redistributes the support of Pauli-Zoperators to facilitate WR. The resulting measurement circuit consists entirely of nearest- neighbor CX gates, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b).A. Weight reduction We begin by structurally decomposing the Pauli-Zob- servableZ rinto its fundamental components. This involves grouping consecutive non-identity (Z) and identity (I) opera- tors into contiguous segments. Formally, we define the following two sets of segments: •Γr k=Z(i1 k)⊗ ··· ⊗Z(iτk(r) k) kis the set of non-identity segments, where eachΓr kis a tensor product ofτ k(r) Pauli-Zterms. •Υr k=I(j1 k)⊗ ··· ⊗I(jβk(r) k) kis the set of identity seg- ments, where eachΥr kis a tensor product ofβ k(r)iden- tity terms. The entire observable is then given by the tensor product of all these segments: Zr= nZO k=1Γr k! ⊗ nIO k=1Υr k! ,(34) The total weightτ(r)is the sum of the lengths of all non- identity segments:τ(r) =PnZ k=1τk(r). To reduce the measured qubits for the observableZ r, we construct a Clifford circuitU Rthat mapsZ rto an effective ob- servableZeff r=URZrU† Rwith lower weight. This is achieved by compressing each high-weight segmentΓr k(τk(r)>1) onto a single qubitt kchosen from its support{i1 k, . . . , iτk(r) k}. The core component of this compression is a chain of CX gates, denoted asU C(i, j), which is defined as follows: UC(i, j) =  CXi,i+1·CX i+1,i+2 ·...·CX j−1,j,ifi < j CX(i,i−1) ·CX (i−1,i−2) ·...·CX (j+1,j) ,ifi > j I⊗n,ifi=j. (35) For each segmentΓr k, we define the Clifford transformation as UR(Γr k, tk) =U C(iτk(r) k, tk)·U C(i1 k, tk), which ensures UR(Γr k, tk)·Γr k·U† R(Γr k, tk) =Z(tk),(36) as proven in Appendix C 1.

Four methods are compared: direct noisy measurement (Noisy), measurement error mitigation with tensor product noise model (TPN), model-free mitigation with random Pauli twirling (MF), and model-free mitigation with subsystem-balanced Pauli twirling (MF(sub)). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) computed from 100 independent replicates. reorganizes the support ofZ rinto contiguous segments with- out altering its total weight, thereby enabling subsequent WR. The fundamental operation of LS is to shift aZoperator to an adjacent qubit. Consider a pair of adjacent qubits(i, i+1). If the original observable containsZ(i)on qubitiandI(i+1) on qubiti+ 1, we can define the shift operation: US(i, i+ 1) =CX i,i+1·CX i+1,i.(38) The transformation ofZ(i)⊗I(i+1)under the action of US(i, i+ 1)yields US·\u0010 Z(i)⊗I(i+1)\u0011 ·U† S=I(i)⊗Z(i+1),(39) effectively shifting theZsupport from qubitito qubiti+ 1 (See Appendix C 2 for proof.). The reverse shift, from I(i−1)⊗Z(i)toZ(i−1)⊗I(i), is achieved by the conjuga- tion operationU S(i, i−1). By sequentially applying these nearest-neighbor shift oper- ations, spatially separated Pauli-Zoperators can be consoli- dated into contiguous blocks. Once contiguity is established, the WR protocol can compress each block for full measure- ment compression. C. Measurement circuit construction for arbitrary effective Pauli-Zobservable By integrating the two techniques above, we can construct a Clifford circuitU MTfor any Pauli-ZobservableZ r, trans- forming it into an effective low-weight observable: Zeff r=U MTZrU† MT.(40) This allows strategic control over the number and locations of Pauli-Zoperators in the measurement basis. Moreover, by re- distributing the observable’s support, the circuit reduces spa- tial proximity among measured qubits, thereby inherently sup- pressing correlated measurement errors that depend on physi- cal layout.The measurement circuitU MTcan be constructed to mapZ r to a single-qubit observable on a target qubitj∈ {1, . . . , n}: UMT·Zr·U† MT=I⊗(j−1)⊗Z(j)⊗I⊗(n−j).(41) This construction is not unique; various sequences of LS and WR operations can achieve the same goal. A typical approach is to first apply LS to group all Pauli-Zterms into one contigu- ous segment, and then apply WR to compress this segment into a single qubit. More generally, the framework extends naturally to arbi- trary effective weightτeff>1by partitioning the qubits intok disjoint subsets{H 1, H2, . . . , H k}, each containing one qubit designated as the measurement site. A similar measurement circuit construction can be applied independently to each sub- set to achieve the desired low-weight effective observable. To estimate the expectation value⟨Z r⟩ρ, we prepare the stateU MTρU† MT, measure in the computational basis, and post- process the outcomes to compute : ⟨Zr⟩ρ=Tr(ρZ r) =Tr(\u0010 UMTρU† MT\u0011 Zeff",

Noise-resilient measurement transformation with Subsystem-Balanced Pauli twirling Although MT provides inherent resilience to measurement noise whenτeff< τ, the physical implementation of the mea- surement circuit inevitably introduces additional gate errors. To characterize the effect of noise, we model the measurement circuit under the standard assumption of gate-independent, CPTP noise. Each ideal gateU iis accompanied by a noise channelE i, yielding the noisy implementation: ˜U= (E lUl)◦...◦(E 2U2)◦(E 1U1).(43) To analyze the cumulative effect of these errors, we prop- agate each noise channel to the end of the measurement cir- cuit through conjugation by the subsequent ideal gates. This 8 transformation is achieved as follows: for any noise channel Eioccurring at thei-th step, we conjugate it by all subsequent gatesU i+1:l =U l◦ ··· ◦U i+1, effectively shifting it to the end of circuit: ˜U=\u0010 El◦(U lEl−1U† l)◦...◦(U 2:lE1U† 2:l)\u0011 ◦U.(44) This expression defines the effective noise channel: Eeff=El◦(U lEl−1U† l)◦...◦(U 2:lE1U† 2:l),(45) which captures the combined effect of all gate errors during the measurement circuit. In the PTM representation, the noisy measurement circuit is modeled as ˜U=C · U, whereCis the PTM of the effective error channelEeff. The resulting noisy expectation value is given by: ⟨˜Zr⟩ρ=⟨⟨Zeff r|R · C · U|ρ⟩⟩,(46) withRdenoting the measurement noise channel. This ex- pression captures the full effect of noise throughout the mea- surement process and leads to a systematic deviation from the ideal expectation value⟨Z r⟩ρ. The diagonal elements ofC, notably[C] ϕ(r)ϕ(r) , multiply the ideal expectation value by a constant factor. This factor can be readily mitigated through calibration, as shown in Eq. 14. However, the off-diagonal terms—including coherent errors—introduce a nontrivial bias that cannot be corrected by simple scaling. To address both measurement noise and the gate errors in- troduced by the measurement circuit, we combine them into a single effective noise channel R=RC. We then apply SB-PT tailored to the effective observableZeff r. For each se- lected Pauli operatorP q∈ Ssub, we first apply the physically transformed operatorP q′=U(P q) =U MTPqU† MTprior to the noisy measurement circuit ˜U, and then virtually apply the originalP qduring classical post-processing as described in Section II B. This unified mitigation framework suppresses er- rors in R, enabling accurate estimation of⟨Z r⟩ρeven in the presence of coherent errors in both measurement and circuit operations. V . NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS To assess the performance of our method, we perform extensive numerical simulations using two classes of noise- free quantum states: (i) random computational-basis product states, and (ii) Haar-random pure states. A. Noise Settings Measurement noise is systematically incorporated via two distinct types of measurement transfer matrices (See detailed illustration in Appendix D 1.). The first type is reconstructed from empirical calibration data of qubits{Q02, Q05, Q06, Q09, Q10, Q11}on theZuchongzhi2.1 su- perconducting quantum processor [28, 30], which",
    "Haar-random pure states. A. Noise Settings Measurement noise is systematically incorporated via two distinct types of measurement transfer matrices (See detailed illustration in Appendix D 1.). The first type is reconstructed from empirical calibration data of qubits{Q02, Q05, Q06, Q09, Q10, Q11}on theZuchongzhi2.1 su- perconducting quantum processor [28, 30], which exhibits a measurement error rate (MER) of0.0452±0.0143. However, since this experimental characterization is limited to six qubits, we introduce a second, programmable synthetic noise model to investigate larger systems. This synthetic noise model incorporates two tunable components, independent and correlated measurement errors, both designed to capture the non-uniform noise profiles observed in real devices. The in- dependent part is constructed as a tensor products of single- qubit transfer matrices, where each error strength is indepen- dently sampled from a normal distribution with mean0.015 and standard deviation0.01. Similarly, the correlated com- ponent is applied to each of then−1adjacent qubit pairs via a two-qubit noise operator based on the continuous-time Markov process (CTMP) model [5]: Λ = exp 4(n−1)X i=1λiGi ,(47) where eachλ iis also drawn independently from a normal distribution with mean0.008and standard deviation0.005. These{λ i}icorrespond to the strengths of the generators {Gi}i, which belong to four fundamental types of two-qubit readout error processes: •|10⟩⟨01| − |01⟩⟨01|refers to readout error01→10, •|01⟩⟨10| − |10⟩⟨10|refers to readout error10→01, •|11⟩⟨00| − |00⟩⟨00|refers to readout error00→11, •|00⟩⟨11| − |11⟩⟨11|refers to readout error11→00. The overall synthetic transfer matrix is constructed as a com- bination of these two noise components. By sampling both independent and correlated error strengths probabilistically, the model introduces qubit-dependent variations that closely emulate the behavior of real superconducting quantum pro- cessors. To model gate noise in the measurement circuit, we employ a hybrid approach combining both incoherent and coherent er- rors. Incoherent noise is introduced via a global depolarizing channel, with error rates set to5×10−4per single-qubit gate and5×10−3per two-qubit gate. Coherent errors are incorpo- rated using a unitary perturbation of the formexp(−iβ 2XX), where the noise strength is set toβ= 0.01. Unless otherwise stated, the first type of transfer matrix is used by default. B.

Results presented in sub-figure (c) are obtained using synthetic measurement noise model, others are obtained using reconstructed noise from calibrated data on theZuchongzhi2.1 superconducting quantum processor. And in simulations for sub-figure (c-e), we use Haar-random pure states. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean computed from 100 independent replicates. methods: direct noisy measurement (Noisy), MEM with TPN model (TPN), MF-MEM with random twirling (MF), and SB- PT [MF(sub)]. Notably, when the size of the twirling set is less than4τ, SB-PT strategically constructs the set to ensure that Pauli terms acting on the measured subsystem are non- repeating. As shown in Fig. 3, SB-PT significantly outperforms ran- dom twirling, achieving superior sampling efficiency and esti- mation accuracy. A key observation is the pronounced perfor- mance leap when the number of random circuits exceeds4τ. This threshold behavior aligns with the theoretical expecta- tion that SB-PT requires significantly fewer samples than ran- dom twirling once the subsystem symmetry is adequately ex- ploited. These results conclusively demonstrate the enhanced efficiency of SB-PT, particularly for low-weight Pauli-Zob- servables, establishing its advantage over conventional miti- gation techniques. We next extend our analysis to global Pauli-Zobservables, where the observable’s weight equals the system sizen. In this regime, SB-PT alone fails to provide advantages due to the high weight of the observable. To address this challenge, we incorporate MT to reduce the global observable to weight- 1 using a circuit of depthn−1(See Appendix D 2 for detailed circuit implementation.). This approach leads to two newhybrid protocols: MF-MEM with MT and random twirling [MT(rnd)], and MF-MEM with MT and SB-PT [MT(sub)]. Notably, the results presented in Fig. 4(c) are obtained using the second type of synthetic measurement noise model. As presented in Fig. 4(a–b), MT(sub) demonstrates a sub- stantial performance advantage, achieving near-optimal error mitigation with very few random circuit instances. Notably, MT(sub) using only ri = 4 attains accuracy comparable to that of the second-best method—MT(rnd) in (a) and MF in (b)— evaluated at ri = 64, corresponding to a 16-fold improvement in sampling efficiency.

The relative error for MT(sub) rises gradually, confirming its favorable scaling for larger systems. In contrast, the relative error for the MF method increases abruptly forn >10, indicating limited scalability. The shot- number dependence in Fig. 4(d) demonstrates that the abso- lute error of MT(sub) continues to improve up to106shots, at which point it exceeds the precision of MT(rnd) by an order of magnitude.

Two observ- ables are evaluated:ZZIZZIandZIZIZI. MT(τeff= 1) denotes the protocol converting the observable to effective weight-1 via mea- surement transformation, while MT(τeff= 2) converts to weight-2. Both employ SB-PT. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM) over 100 independent replicates. increased sampling for uncertainty reduction. As shown in Fig. 4(e), MT(sub) exhibits significantly higher sampling effi- ciency than all other methods: it achieves at ri = 4 an accuracy comparable to that of MF at ri = 100. Collectively, these re- sults affirm that the MT(sub) protocol—enabled by SB-PT— offers superior scaling in both system size and sampling effi- ciency, advancing scalable MEM. Further exploration of the relation between MT(sub) performance and noise parameters is provided in the Appendix D 3. To examine its flexibility under realistic hardware con- straints, where two-qubit gate performance degrades rapidly with circuit depth, we evaluate the trade-off between miti- gation accuracy and the depth of measurement circuit using Haar-random states. We consider two structured Pauli-Zobservables:o 1= ZZIZZIando 2=ZIZIZI. For each observable, we com- pare mitigation using MT with the effective weight reduced toτeff= 1[MT(τeff= 1)] and toτeff= 2[MT(τeff= 2)], both implemented via tailored sequences of WR and LS op- erations and both employing SB-PT (See more details in Ap- pendix D 2). For observableo 1, the support of the effective observable is reduced to qubit{1}underτeff= 1, and to qubits{1,2}underτeff= 2. Similarly, foro 2, the support is restricted to qubit{1}atτeff= 1, and to qubits{1,3}at τeff= 2. As shown in Fig. 5, MT(τeff=2) nearly matches the er-ror rates of MT(τeff=1), while reducing circuit depth by over 50%: from 5 to 1 foro 1and from 6 to 3 foro 2. Notably, de- spite this slight compromise in precision, MT(τeff= 2) still significantly outperforms conventional methods such as TPN and MF methods. These results establish the efficacy of our method in mitigating errors under stringent depth constraints while largely preserving accuracy. VI.

    "slight compromise in precision, MT(τeff= 2) still significantly outperforms conventional methods such as TPN and MF methods. These results establish the efficacy of our method in mitigating errors under stringent depth constraints while largely preserving accuracy. VI. CONCLUSION This work establishes an efficient and scalable framework for measurement error mitigation (MEM) on near-term quan- tum devices through the introduction of subsystem-balanced Pauli twirling (SB-PT). Designed specifically for model-free measurement error mitigation (MF-MEM), SB-PT leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of measurement noise to achieve high performance for sparse Pauli observables. Its conceptual advance is supported by a rigorously derived sam- pling bound that is strictly tighter than that of random Pauli twirling under finite sampling. We further integrate measurement transformation (MT) to extend these advantages to global observables, resulting in a unified architecture that maintains both scalability and hard- ware efficiency. The resulting framework preserves linear cir- cuit depth in the number of qubits and relies on hardware- friendly nearest-neighbor CX gates, making it especially suit- able for superconducting quantum platforms. Crucially, our model offers a unified treatment of native measurement noise and MT-induced gate noise through noise propagation equiva- lence, enabling holistic error mitigation within a coherent MF- MEM pipeline. Comprehensive numerical simulations confirm these ad- vances: SB-PT demonstrates a clear performance separation beyond the theoretical threshold of4τrandom circuits for weight-τobservables, underscoring its superior sampling ef- ficiency. When integrated with MT, the framework achieves up to a 16-fold reduction in required random circuit in- stances while preserving accuracy across increasing system sizes. Furthermore, reducing the effective observable weight from 1 to 2 yields over 50% savings in circuit depth with marginal precision loss, providing practical flexibility for depth-constrained hardware. Looking forward, this work opens multiple paths for ex- tension—including adaptive MT compilation tuned to specific states and devices, experimental validation on superconduct- ing quantum processors, and generalization to tasks such as one-shot verification. By unifying theoretical soundness with hardware-aware design, SB-PT provides a viable pathway to- ward scalable quantum advantage in the NISQ era. Appendix A: The proofs of theorems 1.

The proof of Theorem 2 For Pauli-ZobservableZ r, the scaling factor for anys∈ Jris αϕ(r)ϕ(s) (Ssub) =1 |Ssub|X Pq∈Ssubη(Pq, ZrZs).(A11)We denote the restriction ofP qto the subset supp(Z r) as Pq|r=N i∈supp(Z r)σqi. Similarly, the restriction to the complement ofZ ris denoted asP q|¯r=N i′/∈supp(Z r)σqi′. As for anys∈ J rsupp(Z s)⊆supp(Z r) which indicates (ZrZs)|¯r=I, and(Z rZs)|r̸=I(Z r̸=Z s), then we can arrive at αϕ(r)ϕ(s) (Ssub) =1 |Ssub|X Pq∈Ssubη(Pq|r,(ZrZs)|r)·η(P q|¯r,(ZrZs)|¯r) =1 |Ssub|X Pq∈Ssubη(Pq|r,(ZrZs)|r)·η(P q|¯r, I) =1 |Ssub|X Pq∈Ssubη(Pq|r,(ZrZs)|r) = 0.(A12) In the derivation above, the third equality follows from the identityη(P q, I) = 1for allq∈ {0, . . . ,4n−1}. The fourth equality is obtained by noting that the restricted opera- torP q|r=N i∈supp(Z r)σqiis uniformly distributed over the twirling setSsubof sizec·4τ(r), thereby forming a complete and balanced sampling of the Pauli subgroup on the support ofZr. 3. The proof of Theorem 3 The proof of Eq. 31 is similar to that in Theorem 1, and we only detail the derivation ofκ SB(Ssub). As given in The- orem 2, for anys∈ J r,αϕ(r)ϕ(s) (Ssub)can be regarded as a random variable with •E[a ϕ(r)ϕ(s) ] = 0(forj̸=ϕ(r)), •|aϕ(r)ϕ(s) | ≤1. We can expand the indices inJ rwhich satisfies Eq. A12 beyond the Pauli-Zsubset, since(Z rPq)|¯r=Iholds for any supp(P q)⊆supp(Z r). We define the extension set as Φ(J r) ={ϕ(s)|s∈ J r} ⊆ {0, ...,4n−1}. Applying Hoeffding inequality combined with the union bound over |Φ(J r)|= 4n−τ(r), P\u0012 max j /∈Φ(J r)|αϕ(s)j| ≥ϵ\u0013 ≤2·4n−τ(r)exp\u0012 −|Ssub|ϵ2 2\u0013 , (A13) and we can solve forϵvia setting δ= 2·4n−τ(r)exp\u0012 −|Ssub|ϵ2 2\u0013 ,(A14) we have κSB(Ssub)∆=ϵ=s 2 |Ssub|(2mln 2 + ln(2/δ)),(A15)wherem=n−τ(r) =n− |supp(Z r)|. We next demonstrate that the error bound in Theorem 3 is tighter than that in Theorem 1. Defining the functionf(x) = 2x a−xfor some constanta, it is straightforward to verify that fis monotonically increasing forx < a. Sinceκ(S)> κSB(Ssub)andP j̸=ϕ(r)|[R]ϕ(r)j| ≥P j /∈Φ(J r)|[R]ϕ(r)j| with twirling set of the same size|S|=|Ssub|, we arrive at the conclusion that Theorem 3 provide a tighter error bound.

Appendix B: The Pauli transfer matrix of the tensor product noise model In this section, we will provide the detailed derivation of the Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) structure for the Tensor Product Noise (TPN) model of classical measurement noise. 1. General form of the measurement noise in the PTM representation We begin by deriving the general expression for a classical measurement noiseRin the PTM representation. A classical noise model implies that the noisy measurement process can be described by a conditional probability distribution[Λ] kj= P(noisyj|idealk), fork, j∈ {0, ...,2n−1}. The action ofR on an ideal computational basis state|k⟩⟨k|is R|k⟩⟩=2n−1X j=0Λkj|j⟩⟩,(B1) where|k⟩⟩(|j⟩⟩) is the PTM representation of state|k⟩⟨k| (|j⟩⟨j|). Forp, q∈ {0, ...,4n−1}, the element[R] pq, which describes how the noise channel maps the Pauli operatorP p 13 to the component ofP qin the output, is defined as: [R]pq=1 2n⟨⟨Pp|R|P q⟩⟩. (B2)Since the output ofRis always a diagonal matrix in the com- putational basis (P j···|j⟩⟨j|), the inner product⟨⟨P p|·⟩⟩ will be non-zero only ifP pitself is diagonal in the compu- tational basis. This restrictsP pto the Pauli-Zoperators, i.e., Pp∈ {I, Z}⊗n. This justifies the definition of the Pauli-Z subsetI Zand the reduced matrixR Z. For the matrix ele- ments[R] ϕ(r),ϕ(s) whereP ϕ(r)=Z randP ϕ(s)=Z sare both Pauli-Zoperators (r, s∈ {0, ...,2n−1}), we derive: [R]ϕ(r),ϕ(s) = [R Z]rs=1 2n⟨⟨Zr|R|Z s⟩⟩ =1 2n⟨⟨Zr|R| 2n−1X k=0(−1)s·k|k⟩⟩! =1 2n⟨⟨Zr| 2n−1X k=0(−1)s·kR|k⟩⟩! =1 2n⟨⟨Zr| 2n−1X k=0(−1)s·k2n−1X j=0[Λ]kj|j⟩⟩  =1 2nX k,j[Λ]kj(−1)s·k⟨⟨Zr|j⟩⟩ =1 2nX k,j[Λ]kj(−1)s·k(−1)r·j(since⟨⟨Z r|j⟩⟩= (−1)r·j) =1 2n2n−1X j=0(−1)r·j2n−1X k=0[Λ]kj(−1)s·k,(B3) whereZ rdenotes the PTM representation of Pauli-Zoperator Zr. 2. Factorization under the TPN Model The TPN model assumes the noise is local and uncorrelated across qubits. The conditional probability matrix factorizes as Λ =Nn i=1Λ(i), where the single-qubit response matrix for thei-th qubit is: Λ(i)=\u0012 ai1−b i 1−a ibi\u0013 =\u0012 P(0|0)P(0|1) P(1|0)P(1|1)\u0013 . We introduce the parametersω iandζ ias defined in the main text: ωi=ai+bi−1, ζi=ai−bi. These parameters define the single-qubit PTMR(i) Zfor the Pauli-Zoperators{I, Z}on thei-th qubit: R(i) Z=\u0012 1 0 ωiζi\u0013 .(B4)Due to the tensor product structure of the noise, the overall reduced PTMR Zis the tensor product of the single-qubit PTMs: RZ=nO i=1R(i) Z=nO i=1\u0012 1 0 ωiζi\u0013 .(B5) For the Pauli-ZoperatorsZ r=Nn i=1ZriandZ s=Nn i=1Zsi(r,s∈Zn 2), where we denoteZ0=IandZ1=Z, the matrix element[R Z]rsis a product over the qubitsi= 1 ton: [RZ]rs=nY i=1[R(i) Z]risi.(B6) For the overall product to be non-zero, we must avoid any fac- tor wherer i= 0ands i= 1, as this gives[R(i) Z]0,1= 0. This is precisely the condition supp(Z s)⊆supp(Z r), defining the TPN subsetT. For(r, s)∈T, the product simplifies. We separate the qubits into three groups: • Qubitsiwheres i= 1. Since(r, s)∈T, we must haver i= 1for these qubits. Their contribution to the product isQ i:si=1ζi. • Qubitsiwherer i= 1buts i= 0. Their contribution isQ i:ri=1,s i=0ωi. 14 /uni0000000b/uni00000044/uni0000000c/uni00000034/uni00000051/uni00000020/uni00000015 /uni00000034/uni00000051/uni00000020/uni00000017 /uni00000034/uni00000051/uni00000020/uni00000019 /uni0000000b/uni00000045/uni0000000c/uni00000034/uni00000051/uni00000020/uni00000015 /uni00000034/uni00000051/uni00000020/uni00000017 /uni00000034/uni00000051/uni00000020/uni00000019",

(b) The programmable synthetic transfer matrix which incorporates dual noise components—independent and correlated measurement errors. • Qubitsiwherer i= 0(and consequentlys i= 0).

The first product quantifies the faithful transmission of aZerror on the qubits in the support ofZs, while the second product captures the noise introduced on qubits that are measured but did not have an underlying error. Appendix C: The measurement circuit used for measurement transformation 1. The circuit for weight reduction LetΓr k=Z(i1 k)⊗...⊗Z(iτk(r) k)be a Pauli-Zoperator acting onτk(r)contiguous qubits. The wight reduction (WR) circuitis defined as: UR(Γr k, tk) =U C(iτk(r) k, tk)·UC(i1 k, tk), tk∈ {i1 k, ..., iτk(r) k}, (C1) whereU C(i, j)is a chain of CX gates: UC(i, j) =  CXi,i+1·CX i+1,i+2 ·...·CX j−1,j,ifi < j CX(i,i−1) ·CX (i−1,i−2) ·...·CX (j+1,j) ,ifi > j I⊗n,ifi=j. (C2) We now show that under this transformation, the effective Pauli observable becomesZ(tk). The conjugate action of a CX gate CX i,j, with qubitias control and qubitjas target, on Pauli operators is: CXi,j·(Z(i)⊗Z(j))·CX† i,j=I(i)⊗Z(j).(C3) Then for the WR circuit, we have 15 (a)First-qubit WR(b) Mid-qubit WR Weight-1 MT for ZZIZZI Z Z Z Z Z ZZ I I I I IZ Z Z Z Z ZZII I I I(c) Z Z I Z Z IIIZ I I I Weight-1 MT for ZIZIZI (d) Z I Z Z IIIZ I I IIWeight-2 MT for ZZIZZI (e) Z Z I Z Z IIIZ I IWeight-2 MT for ZIZIZI (f) Z I Z Z IIZ I I II ZZ FIG. 7.The measurement circuits used for measurement transformation.Direct measurements of the targeted Pauli-Zobservables (yellow) are equivalent to measuring the effective observables (red) via circuits a–f.

The circuit for location shift The location shift (LS) circuit is defined as: US(i, i+ 1) =CX i,i+1·CX i+1,i.(C5) We now demonstrate that this unitary transformation effects the desired Pauli observable shift: US(i, i+ 1)·(Z(i)⊗I(i+1))·U† S(i, i+ 1) =I(i)⊗Z(i+1).(C6) The transformation proceeds in two stages.

Simulations use six-qubit noiseless Haar-random states under the synthetic measurement noise model . (a) The absolute error with increasing correlated measurement error rate (Corr MER). (b) The absolute error with increasing coherent gate error rate (Coherent GER). We set the standard Ind MER as 0.015, the Corr MER as 0.008, and the Coherent GER as 0.01.2. Circuit implementation for simulations The circuit implementation used in our simulations is il- lustrated in Fig. 7. It shows how direct measurements of targeted Pauli-Zobservables can be equivalently performed using measurement circuits tailored to their effective observ- ables. 3. Extended simulation results In this section, we investigate the robustness of the MT(sub) method against key noise parameters using a synthetic mea- surement noise model that incorporates both independent and correlated measurement errors, as well as coherent gate errors in the measurement circuit. We focus specifically on the cor- related measurement error rate (MER) and the coherent gate error rate (GER), noting that independent measurement noise and incoherent gate noise are not considered here since they can be effectively suppressed by model-free error mitigation, as discussed in Section II B. As shown in Fig. 8, MT(sub) exhibits strong resilience to both correlated measurement errors and coherent gate errors at moderate noise levels. Notably, when the correlated MER and GER remain below10−2, the performance degradation of MT(sub) is minimal, demonstrating its stability under re- alistic noise conditions. This robust behavior highlights the practicality of MT(sub) for near-term quantum devices where correlated and coherent errors are non-negligible. [1] M. A. Nielsen and I.
