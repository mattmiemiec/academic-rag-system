Box 1029 Blindern, 0315 Oslo, Norway (Dated: September 30, 2025) Scale invariance is a hallmark of many natural systems, including solar flares, where energy re- lease spans a vast range of scales. Recent computational advances, at the level of both algorithmics and hardware, have enabled high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to span multiple scales, offering new insights into magnetic energy dissipation processes. Here, we study scale invariance of magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. Current sheets are identified and analyzed over time. Results demonstrate that dissipative events exhibit scale invariance, with power-law distributions characterizing their energy dissipation and lifetimes. Re- markably, these distributions are consistent across the two simulations, despite differing numerical and physical setups, suggesting universality in the process of magnetic energy dissipation. Compar- isons between the evolution of dissipation regions reveals distinct growth behaviors in high plasma- β regions (convective zone) and low plasma- βregions (atmosphere). The latter display spatiotemporal dynamics similar to those of avalanche models, suggesting self-organized criticality and a common universality class. Scale invariance is found in many natural systems, from the evolution of forest fires to the distribution of earthquake magnitudes [1]. In the Sun, this property emerges for solar flares, where energy is released across a vast range of scales [2–4]. The most energetic of these events can have significant impacts on Earth [5] and as such, understanding them is key to produce predictions. However, solar flares have been hard to model from first principles due to the wide disparity of spatial and tem- poral scales at play. Furthermore, the small-scale nature of magnetic reconnection dynamics, and the complex be- haviour of the resulting magnetic energy dissipation [6, 7] makes the modelling even more arduous. Avalanche models have been successful in reproduc- ing the statistical properties of flares [8–11], and other scale invariant processes, from earthquakes to forest fires [12, 13]. In the case of solar flares, these models might be capturing the intricate collective dynamics of recon- nection events [14–16]. In fact, a nanoflare [17] can be conceptually linked to the idea of a local instability. Bridging the gap between scale invariant models for solar flares and comprehensive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations is nevertheless lacking. Despite cap- turing the global statistics [8], avalanche models rely on ad hoc evolutionary rules, in contrast to the detailed physics described by MHD; reconciling them into a com- mon physical framework is far from trivial [15, 18–21]. However, MHD simulations can provide physical ground- ing to these ad hoc rules.

State-of-the-art MHD simula- tions can now resolve finer spatial scales, providing in- sights into energy dissipation mechanisms that were pre- viously unattainable [6, 7]. It is now possible to investi- gate whether energy dissipation in simulated low plasma- βenvironments ( βis the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure [22]), is scale invariant, and if it occurs throughavalanches. To address this question, we analyze magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. More pre- cisely, we identify regions of high magnetic gradients where ohmic dissipation is expected to occur and ana- lyze their evolution. The two simulation setups we use in this study are displayed in figure 1. The first (top panel) is a state of the art Bifrost simulation [23], which is a 3D MHD solar-like atmosphere extending from the top of the convective zone to the lower-corona1. It is a quiet-Sun simulation (ch012023 by800) experiencing a network-like flux emergence episode. This simulation is designed to capture two dynamically different regimes. First, the convective zone along with the photosphere and lower chromosphere, hereafter CONV, span approximately the lower third of the simulation and are in a high plasma- β regime. The upper-chromosphere, the transition region and the beginning of the corona, hereafter ATMO, span the upper two thirds of the simulation and are mostly in a low plasma- βregime. We also study a completely dif- ferent setup in a PLUTO simulation2, shown in figure 1 (bottom panel). This simulation, designed as a test case to study dissipative events, is a bipolar arcade embedded in a stratified low- βatmosphere and slowly twisted at its base. Saying that these two simulations are different is an understatement. Table I lists various simulation charac- teristics and parameter values, to highlight the fact they they differ markedly from one another, in terms of both numerical and physical setups. We focus on locations with strong magnetic dissipation, 1Q. Noraz, et al. A&A (submitted) 2A. Blaise, et al. in PreparXiv:2509.25066v1 [astro-ph.SR] 29 Sep 2025 2 FIG. 1.

The value of ∆ = 0 .01Mm (Bifrost) and ∆ = 0 .035Mm (PLUTO) which corresponds to ∆ =1 2computational cell width is chosen to maximize simultaneously the num- ber of identified zones and the range of their volumes. However, our results are robust to variations of ∆, as discussed in Appendix A. All cells for which the inequality 1 holds are defined as ac- tive cells. Active zones (hereafter zones) are defined using the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm [24, 25] which identifies clusters defined as diagonally and horizontally connected active cells, displayed as green isosurfaces in figure 1. Each zone is assigned a label and an ancestry algorithm4 is applied to track their temporal evolution. A first step in characterizing these dissipation zones is to calculate the joule heating QJ= 4πηJ2 c2(2) where ηis the magnetic diffusivity and Jis the electric current density. It quantifies the transfer of energy from the magnetic field to internal energy. We compute the amount of magnetic energy dissipated by a zone by inte- grating QJover its time-varying volume, over its lifetime. From this, we construct probability density functions (PDFs) for the dissipated magnetic energy and lifetime of the zones, as shown in figure 2. These frequency dis- tributions are characterized by extended power-law tails, spanning more than eight orders of magnitudes in energy and two orders of magnitude in lifetimes. The best-fit ex- ponents are listed in the figure. These values are roughly consistent with previous analyzes carried out on a similar 4Our ancestry algorithm is analogous to the one described in [26]. However, in mergers and splitting, which account for 10% of events, the largest zone keeps its label whereas the smallest is considered ended, or created. 3 15 20 25 30 Dissipated Energy (erg) (log10)12.5 10.0 7.5 5.0 2.5 0.02.5PDF (log10) AATMO 1.36±0.02 CONV 1.58±0.01 PLUTO 1.36±0.01 1 2 3 Lifetime (s) (log10)5 4 3 2 1 0PDF (log10) B2.13±0.07 2.46±0.06 2.1±0.1 FIG. 2.

Bifrost simulation, using a completely distinct zone iden- tification scheme [27], which strengthens our confidence in our identification algorithm. For all distributions, the low energies generally associated to zones comprised of a few cells are discarded from the fit performed with a random sample consensus method [28]. It is noteworthy that the low plasma- βregimes of the two simulations, with completely different setups, are described by simi- lar power laws in energies and lifetimes. This result not only confirms that dissipative events are scale invariant in MHD simulations, but also hints at the universality of this process. Many physical mechanisms can lead to the existence of power-laws for the distribution of energy dissipated in localized regions. A paramount example can be found in MHD turbulence (akin to the CONV region in our Bifrost simulation), which is well-known for producing such power-laws [26, 29]. However, other generators of power laws exist in physical systems [30, 31], such as for instance avalanching processes and criticality. Asserting which frameworks can be used to describe this dissipation thus requires going beyond power-laws. Avalanching systems have a characteristic evolution [32] controlled by a set of local rules of interaction be- tween the smallest components of the system. Scale invariance and universality emerge naturally from such systems. A large event is simply a collection of smaller ones. Under slow driving, many such systems evolve au- tonomously towards a self-organized critical state, which naturally leads to scale invariance. The Lu and Hamilton [33] avalanche model for solar flares (hereafter LH93) is an archetypal example. It is akin to a classical sandpile model [34], in which sand grains are added until the local slope exceeds a threshold and the pile becomes unstable. At this point, an unstable site will redistribute some sand to its neighbour to re- store stability, but doing so may render its neighbours 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Lifetime (seconds) (log10)0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5New Active Cells (Count) (log10)AVALANCHE 0.83±0.02PLUTO 0.86±0.12ATMO 1.08±0.05CONV 0.22±0.02FIG. 3.

In this model, scale invariance of avalanches emerges naturally from the stability and re- distribution rules, which are purely local, and remains robust to changes in model parameters such as the mag- nitude of the driving [9], provided a good separation of timescales exists between energy loading and avalanch- ing.

    "in model parameters such as the mag- nitude of the driving [9], provided a good separation of timescales exists between energy loading and avalanch- ing. The local interactions will then determine the way un- stable regions grow in these systems. This is typically assessed by critical exponents, which quantify the spa- tiotemporal evolution of these systems and define uni- versality classes [32]. In this study, we focus on a spread- ing exponent [24, 35, 36] which characterizes the rate at which unstable zones grow over the lattice. It is recovered from the relation N(t) =tn, (3) where Nis the number of new active cells at lifetime t, averaged over all dissipation events occurring over the duration of a given simulation, and nis the spreading exponent. We compute the spreading exponent nfor CONV and ATMO in the Bifrost simulation, the PLUTO simulation, and a Lu and Hamilton avalanche model (LH93). As shown in figure 3 in all cases, the average number of new active cells N(t) grows as a power-law of time. These are fitted in logspace to measure their slope, directly yielding the spreading exponent n. Zones in the CONV region start on average with ∼3 (100.5) active cells and the number of newly added cells per successive snapshot never exceeds 10. In contrast, zones in the ATMO region start on average with ∼25 (101.4) active cells and the number of newly added active cells exhibits marked power-law growth. Similar evolution is observed 4 in the PLUTO simulation and the avalanche model5. The spreading exponent that quantifies these evolutions are listed in figure 3 as well as in table II, appendix B. Videos of the evolution of sample zones in ATMO and CONV are provided in supplementary material. In those videos, orange cubes are new active cells and green cubes are persisting active cells. In CONV, the new active cells show marked spatiotemporal variability and are vertically aligned, which is to be expected from a high plasma- βturbulent regime dominated by convective downflows. In ATMO, the new active cells are typically contiguous to active neighbours and the zone forms a sheet-like structure. To summarize, externally driven homogeneous isotropic turbulence and SOC both generate scale invariance and both dissipate energy at the smallest length scales. However, in turbulence, energy is transfered from large scales to small scales, whereas the opposite can be argued for SOC where small-scale instabilities can destabilize larger areas through avalanches. In that regard, distinguishing between generators requires characterizing the spatiotemporal evolution of energy dissipation regions. In light of this, we assert that the evolution of zones in low plasma- βregimes (ATMO and PLUTO), are compatible with avalanche models, and confirm that zones in high plasma- βenvironments, such as CONV evolve differently than in low plasma- β environments. The much smaller value of nin CONV further underlines the distinct nature of the dissipative dynamics in the MHD-convective turbulent regime, where we do not expect avalanches to occur. Systems near criticality have characteristic relations between their critical exponents [35]. These relations should hold for any system at or near criticality [35,",
    "smaller value of nin CONV further underlines the distinct nature of the dissipative dynamics in the MHD-convective turbulent regime, where we do not expect avalanches to occur. Systems near criticality have characteristic relations between their critical exponents [35]. These relations should hold for any system at or near criticality [35, 36]. Thus, we verify if one such relation holds for our mod- els. This relation, detailed in appendix B, is based on another critical exponent, τ, describing the probability distribution for zone sizes. Figure 4 shows that the low- βregimes, ATMO and PLUTO, along with the LH93 model (AVALANCHE) all yield measured values for τ which are in acceptable agreement with the theoretical value. On the other hand, the measured value of τfor high plasma- β(CONV) is in marked disagreement with the theoretical value τ∗, showing that the CONV region is likely far from a critical regime. These reinforce the stark contrast between the high and low βregimes in the Bifrost simulation and supporting the conjecture that the associated power-law reflect the turbulent state of the plasma, and does not indicate criticality. The good agreement between the measured and com- puted critical exponents τandτ∗(viz. Fig 4) in the low-βregion of the Bifrost and PLUTO simulations is 5Time in the LH93 is measured in discrete iterations, but was rescaled to second here for comparison purposes in figure 3, which does not affect the value of the exponent AVALANCHE PLUTO ATMO CONV1.52.0τMeasured TheoreticalFIG. 4. Consistency test for the measured value of τ(Eq. B1) and its theoretical value τ∗(Eq. B2) where a ±2σinterval is used for the error bars. The larger range on τ∗(gray box) for PLUTO is caused by smaller sample size for zones in that simulation. indicative of these simulations operating at or near a crit- ical point. Since neither simulation is subjected to fine tuning via an external control parameter, this critical- ity must be of the self-organized variety. Self-organized criticality (SOC)[37, 38] is understood to materialize in slowly-driven open dissipative systems subjected to a lo- cal threshold instability [37, 39]. In the Bifrost simu- lation, the evolution of the ATMO region is driven by the magnetic footpoints being anchored in a turbulent convective layer with typical turnover timescale ∼103s; whereas in PLUTO a slow global twist is imposed at the footpoint of the pre-existing magnetic arcade, with timescale ≃105s. This is much longer than the life- time of all but the longest dissipation events observed in both simulations (viz. Fig. 2B), so that both systems can be legitimately considered slowly-driven. Activation of enhanced dissipation represents a form of threshold instability [6, 7], which affect plasma conditions locally and eventually brings the system back below threshold. The basic requirements for SOC are thus satisfied. Our analyzes thus support the conjecture that the low- βre- gions of the solar chromosphere and lower corona are in a self-organized critical state, with conversion of magnetic energy to heat taking place through avalanches of small dissipative events [17], and scale-free avalanches mapping naturally on scale-free energy release in flares [39].

Appendix A: Threshold Variations We have verified that the choice of the activation threshold length scale ∆ in Eq. B3 does not affect sig- nificantly the power-law form and logarithmic slopes of the distribution of dissipation event sizes. As can be seen on Figure 5, only the small event end of the distribution is affected by variations of ∆, while the power-law tail of large events, of primary interest in our study, remains unaffected over more than six orders of magnitude in dis- sipated energy.Appendix B: Critical Exponents Critical exponents characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of systems near their critical point, and can be used collectively to define universality classes [32]. These exponents can be recovered by fitting associated distri- butions of event size measures and are related to one another via theoretically-derived numerical relationships [35]. One such exponent, τ, quantifies the growth of an unstable region via the power-law relationship: P(S)∼S−τ, (B1) where P(S) is the probability that an active zone reaches a size Sin its lifetime. This exponent is directly acces- sible from simulation output, and in critical systems can be related to other critical exponents [35, 36]: τ∗=1 +n+ 2δ 1 +n+δ, (B2) where nis the spreading exponent defined in equation 3, andδcharacterizes the probability distribution P(t) that a zone is still active at time t: P(t)∼t−δ.
