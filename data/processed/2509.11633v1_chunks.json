Abstract—Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is essential for identifying malicious activities, fraud, and unexpected behaviors in real-world systems such as cybersecurity and power grids. However, existing approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHoutperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHis practical and effective for fast, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs. Index Terms—Anomaly Detection, Streaming, Real-time, Dynamic Graphs, Edge Streams, Tensor Sketching I. INTRODUCTION Dynamic graph data is increasingly prevalent in real-time systems such as cybersecurity, social media, power grids, and fraud detection [1]–[3]. These systems generate massive, high-velocity streams of edges, representing relationships between nodes, and often exhibit evolving topologies and complex structural patterns. Detecting anomalies in such settings is critical for identifying malicious behavior, data breaches, and abnormal user activity. However, traditional graph-based anomaly detection techniques, most based on personalized randomized walks [4], matrix factorization [5], and subgraph snapshot aggregation [2], [6], struggle in streaming environments. They often rely on storing the full adjacency matrix or computing expensive subgraph statistics, leading to high memory overhead and delayed detection. Moreover, many existing models lackadaptability to rapid changes in network behavior and fail to provide interpretable, probabilistic outputs [3]. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, streaming anomaly detection framework called ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, which operates in real time without storing the full graph. Our method integrates temporalmulti-tensor sketching [7] with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) [8] to compactly track edge frequencies using bounded memory, while mitigating hash collisions common in streaming settings. To enhance the detection of fast-changing anomalies, we incorporate Bayesian posterior scoring for uncertainty-aware inference and apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) smoothing [9] for dynamic thresholding. The EWMA parameters are adaptively tuned based on burst intensity (i.e., the rate of edge activity spikes within short time windows), enabling the model to adapt to concept drift and volatility in graph streams. Unlike existing sketch-based models such as MIDAS-R [1] and F-FADE [6], which lack probabilistic reasoning and struggle under bursty or rapidly evolving network",
    "on burst intensity (i.e., the rate of edge activity spikes within short time windows), enabling the model to adapt to concept drift and volatility in graph streams. Unlike existing sketch-based models such as MIDAS-R [1] and F-FADE [6], which lack probabilistic reasoning and struggle under bursty or rapidly evolving network dynamics, ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHintegrates temporal multi-tensor sketching, CMS-CU, Bayesian inference, and EWMA-based dynamic thresholding into a unified, real-time detection pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first edge-level streaming anomaly detection framework to combine these components into a probabilistic model with mathematically justified threshold adaptation. The key contributions of this work are: •We propose a real-time anomaly detection framework that leverages temporal multi-tensor sketching to compactly track edge frequencies with bounded memory. •We integrate Count-Min Sketch with Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to efficiently track edge frequencies while mitigating hash collisions within the sketch tensor. •We introduce a Bayesian inference for computing posterior anomaly scores that reflect uncertainty and adaptivity to evolving graph behaviors. •We design an EWMA-based adaptive thresholdingarXiv:2509.11633v1 [cs.LG] 15 Sep 2025 mechanism with burst-tuned smoothing to enhance robustness in volatile graph streams. •We conduct extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets.ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHdelivers competitive performance on DARPA and ISCX-IDS2012 and achieves up to 6.5% and 15.6% AUC improvements on CIC-IDS2018 and CIC-DDoS2019 respectively, while processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds with only 10 hash functions (i.e., row depth in the CMS-CU), demonstrating strong detection accuracy and runtime efficiency. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work; Section III presents the preliminaries and problem definition; Section IV describes the methodology; Section V reports the experimental results; and Section VI concludes the paper with future directions.

In this section, we review existing methods for detecting anomalies in dynamic graphs. We group prior work into three main categories based on their algorithmic strategies. Each class offers different trade-offs in terms of scalability, adaptability, and memory efficiency. For broader coverage, we refer readers to [3], [13]. Edge Stream Methods:SEDANSPOT[10] detects sparse edge anomalies based on occurrence patterns. PENMINER[11] captures persistence in edge updates, while F-FADE [6] models frequency patterns via likelihood estimation. MIDAS-R [1] uses Count-Min Sketch with chi-squared testing for anomaly scoring. However, these approaches lack probabilistic reasoning, struggle with bursty behavior, and often require high computational cost. Our method addresses these gaps through multi-tensor sketching, Bayesian inference, and adaptive thresholding. Probabilistic Sketch Methods:Count-Min Sketch (CMS) [8] has been used for scalable frequency estimation in graph streams.

RHSS [14] applies CMS to edge properties, while ANOEDGE[12] uses higher-order sketching forcount-based deviations. DECAYRANK[15] extends PageRank with temporal decay for node anomaly detection, and ADAPTIVE-DECAYRANK[4] enhances this by using Bayesian updates and dynamic thresholds. While memory-efficient, these methods [1], [12], [14], [15] often rely on fixed thresholds and lack general uncertainty modeling, limiting performance in high-frequency edge streams. In contrast, ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHintegrates 3D tensor sketching with conservative updates, Bayesian scoring, and dynamic EWMA-based thresholding for robust, real-time adaptation. Matrix Factorization Methods:DENSESTREAM[2] incrementally tracks dense subtensors. EDGEMONITOR[16] models edge transitions using first-order Markov chains. MULTILAD [5] uses spectral decomposition for subgraph anomalies. While effective offline, these methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time settings. In contrast, our method avoids global recomputation and uses bounded-memory summaries for efficient real-time edge anomaly detection. As summarized in Table I, our method is the first to unify temporal sketching, conservative updates, Bayesian scoring, and adaptive thresholding in a single real-time pipeline. It offers a practical balance between scalability, interpretability, and resilience under volatile graph streams. III.

As shown in Figure 1, edge-level anomalies may manifest as sudden bursts or emerging microclusters. For example, nodeu rapidly connects to nodes{v 1, v2, . . . , v m}atG t+1, while rare edge spikes att= 5andt= 8indicate unexpected frequency surges. A. Count-Min Sketch (CMS) CMS [14] is a probabilistic data structure for frequency estimation using a 2D array of counters anddhash functions. For an itemx, its frequency estimate is computed as: ˆf(x) =d min i=1CMi,hi(x).(2) wheredis the number of hash functions, andh i(x)is thei-th hash function. CMS achieves significant memory reduction and offers sublinear memory usage but suffers from overestimate counts due tohash collisionscounter [17], where multiple elements are mapped to the same. B. CMS with Conservative Update (CMS-CU) CMS-CU [8] improved upon the standard CMS [14] by reducing overestimation errors from hash collisions. Unlike CMS, which increments all counters corresponding to hash functions, CMS-CU only updates those counters with the current minimum value. Given an edgee= (u, v), we maintain two sketches: CMS-CU current for the current time window and CMS-CU totalfor cumulative history.Letv ibe the value of the counter indexed byh i(x), we update only the counters equal to the row minimum: vi←vi+ 1ifv i=d min j=1vj,(3) The frequency estimate of an elementxis obtained by retrieving the minimum counter value across all hash functions: ˆf(x) =d min i=1CMS-CU i,hi(x).(4) C. Tensor Sketching Tensor Sketching [7] generalizes pairwise edge tracking to higher-order interactions. Given an edge(u, v, t), its outer product is approximated in polynomial kernel space via sketch composition: ˆf(k) uv(t) =FFT−1(FFT(S u)◦FFT(S v)),(5) whereS u,Svare hash-based sketches ofuandv, and◦ denotes element-wise multiplication. ˆf(k) uv(t)capturesk-order edge patterns in compressed form. While classical tensor sketching uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for convolution, our method skips FFT by directly updating a 3D Count-Min Sketch, enabling real-time, memory-efficient edge tracking. D. Bayesian Anomaly Scoring Bayesian inference [18] offers a probabilistic framework for combining prior beliefs with observed data to estimate event likelihood. In anomaly detection, it enables the adaptive computation of the posterior probability that an observation (e.g., edge or node interaction) is anomalous based on past behavior. We define Bayes’ Theorem as: P(Anomaly|a,H) =P(a|Anomaly)·P(Anomaly) P(a),(6) whereais the observed frequency andHis historical data. This allows adaptive, uncertainty-aware scoring. E. Problem Statement We aim to detect anomalies in a dynamic edge streamE= {e1, e2, . . .}, where each edgee i= (u i, vi, ti)represents an interaction from sourceu i∈Vto destinationv i∈Vat time ti. The goal is to assign an anomaly score to each edge based on its deviation from historical patterns. PROBLEM1.Given a streaming graphE, compute an anomaly score for each incoming edgee= (u, v, t)by comparing its observed frequency with historical behavior.

PROBLEM1.Given a streaming graphE, compute an anomaly score for each incoming edgee= (u, v, t)by comparing its observed frequency with historical behavior. Higher scores reflect unusual edge behavior, such as rare spikes or rapid bursts of interactions. An edgee= (u, v, t)is flagged asanomalousif its score exceeds a dynamic thresholdα, which adapts over time to balance sensitivity and false positive control, as shown in Figure 1. IV. METHOD In this section, we present ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight, edge-level, real-time anomaly detection algorithm using a Multi-layer Tensor Sketch structure. The method accurately tracks temporal patterns in edge streams while maintaining low memory and computation overhead. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 3. The key innovations in our method include: •Multi-layer Tensor Sketching:A compact 3D sketch S∈Rd×w×t wencodes edge frequencies over time using hash-based layers. •Lightweight Frequency Estimation:A 3D CMS with Conservative Updates (CMSCU) estimates counts across (d, w, t w)while reducing overestimation. •Temporal Decay and Pruning:Applies exponential decay (γ) and sliding window to focus on recent activity. •Adaptive Bayesian Scoring:Computes posterior score P(Anomaly|a, s, t)from sketch-derived statistics. •Dynamic Thresholding:Uses EWMA andτ t=µt+kσ t for adaptive detection with smoothed thresholds.

An incoming edge(u, v, t) is processed using multiple hash functionsh 1, h2, . . . , h d, where eachh i maps the edge to a bucketjin thei-th sketch layer. The time dimension is discretized into bins viab t=⌊t/∆⌋. The 3D sketch tensorS[i][j][b t]is then updated using Count-Min Sketch with Conservative Update (CMS-CU), where only the minimum counter across all hash layers is incremented. A. Multi-Layer Tensor Sketching To approximate evolving edge behavior over time, we introduce a3Dtensor sketch structureS∈Rd×w×Wthat compactly encodes edge frequency dynamics usinghash-based projection and time-aware indexing. Inspired by prior work on tensor sketching for efficient high-dimensional approximation via randomized hashing [7]. We introduce a third axis for time-aware indexingt w, our tensor sketch captures edge dynamics acrossdhash rows,wbuckets, andWtime bins with bounded memory. This process is illustrated in Figure 2, where the incoming edge(u, v, t)∈ Eis hashed across multiple layers and projected into a 3D sketch tensor indexed by time.We define the dynamic graph stream as a sequence of timestamped edge events(u, v, t)∈ E. To model temporal evolution, we divide the timeline into fixed-size intervals of width∆, and assign each edge to a corresponding time bin: bt=\u0016t ∆\u0017 , b t∈ {1,2, . . . , W},(7) where,tis the timestamp of edge(u, v)in the stream,∆is the time bin width, andWthe maximum number of active time bins maintained in the tensor sketchS∈Rd×w×W. We use a family ofdpairwise-independent hash functions {h1, h2, . . . , h d}, where eachh i:N×N→ {1,2, . . . , w} maps an edge(u, v)to acolumn bucketin thei-th hash row.

The sketch cellS[i, h i(u, v), b t]stores the interaction frequency of edge(u, v)in the corresponding time bin. Each edge arrival(u, v, t), triggers ahash-based projection into alldrows of the tensor sketch by updating: S[i][h i(u, v)][b t]←S[i][h i(u, v)][b t] + 1,(8) fori= 1tod. We adopt the conservative update (CMS-CU) mechanism [8], where only sketch counters with the current minimum value among{S[j][h j(u, v)][b t]}d j=1are incremented. IfS[i][h i(u, v)][b t] = min jS[j][h j(u, v)][b t],(9) whereh i(u, v)is thei-th hash function mapping edge(u, v) to a sketch column, andb t=\u0004t ∆\u0005 is the current time bin index for timestampt. The estimated frequency of edge(u, v)in the current bin is defined as: ˆauv(t) =d min i=1S[i][h i(u, v)][b t],(10) whereˆa uv(t)denotes the estimated occurrence count of edge (u, v)in time binb t. To maintain long-term context, we define the cumulative frequency of the edge as: ˆsuv(t) =btX k=1ˆauv(k),(11) whereˆs uv(t)captures the aggregated frequency of edge(u, v) over all bins up tob t. Unlike traditional2Dadjacency matricesX∈Rd×w, which lack temporal granularity and grow linearly with graph size, our3Dtensor sketchS∈Rd×w×Wmaintains a fixed memory bound ofO(d·w·W)and enables real-time edge tracking with sublinear space. Edge updates are processed in constant time, O(1). By organizing the sketch along discrete time bins, our approach supports efficienttemporal querying, decay-based forgetting, and scalable sliding window maintenance. Algorithm 1 summarizes the complete edge processing pipeline, including tensor updates, decay, sketching, and frequency estimation.

The output is a ranked anomaly list for edges in the stream. B. Frequency Estimation with Conservative Updates We employ CMS-CU [8] as a lightweight and memory-efficient data structure for tracking edge frequencies in graph streams. For a given edgee= (u, v, t), theestimated frequencyof edge(u, v)at timetis denoted byˆa uv(t), while thecumulative historical frequencyup totisˆs uv(t). To reduce bias from hash collisions, CMS-CU selectively increments only the counters with the current minimum values: vi←vi+ 1ifv i=d min j=1vj,(12) The estimated frequency of itemxis then: ˆf(x) =d min i=1CMS-CU i,hi(x).(13) C. Raw Anomaly Score Based on Frequency Deviation Once the current frequencyˆa uv(t)and cumulative count ˆsuv(t)are estimated, we compute aRaw Anomaly Scoreto quantify how much recent edge activity deviates from expected behavior. Leta= ˆa uv(t)ands= ˆs uv(t). The raw anomaly score is: RawScore(u, v, t) =(a−s t)2·t s·(t−1).(14) This formulation captures the squared deviation of current activity from historical average, normalized by variance, and highlights bursts or drops in edge behavior.D. Adaptive Probabilistic Scoring via Bayesian Inference To incorporate adaptivity and capture uncertainty, we extend the score in Equation 14 into a Bayesian framework, modeling short-term activity against long-term trends. We then assume the mean and variance under normal behavior: µ=s t, σ2=s t2 1.Likelihood under Normal: P(a|Normal) =1√ 2πσ2exp\u0012 −(a−µ)2 2σ2\u0013 (15) 2.Likelihood under Anomaly:We model anomalous behavior by shifting the mean and inflating the variance: µA=µ+δ, σ2 A= 4σ2 P(a|Anomaly) =1p 2πσ2 Aexp\u0012 −(a−µ A)2 2σ2 A\u0013 (16) 3.Posterior Inference:Assuming a fixed prior P(Anomaly) =p 0, the posterior probability is computed via Bayes’ rule: P(Anomaly|a) =P(a|Anomaly)·p 0 P(a),(17) whereP(a) =P(a|Anomaly)·p 0+P(a|Normal)·(1− p0),and the posterior gives an adaptive and normalized anomaly score for edge(u, v)at timet, reflecting both statistical deviation and uncertainty in observed behavior. E. Streaming Temporal Decay and Pruning To emphasize recency and maintain bounded memory, we incorporate two temporal mechanisms into the sketch: (i) exponential decay and (ii) sliding window pruning.

Smaller values ofγcause faster decay, giving more weight to recent edge activity. This mechanism mimics a form oftemporal forgetting[4], where recent events dominate. b) Sliding Window Pruning.:To further constrain memory usage, we adopt a fixed-size sliding window strategy that retains only the most recentWtime bins (i.e., snapshots of edge activity). Letb tbe the current time bin index at time t, andbrepresent an existing bin in the sketch. Any bin that falls outside the window horizon is zeroed out: Ifbt−b > W⇒S[i][j][b]←0(19)This pruning operation removes stale sketch slices entirely, freeing memory and removing obsolete edge history. It also prevents the anomaly scoring logic from being biased by long-term drift or noise. Together, decay and pruning act as a dual temporal filter. Algorithm 2 outlines how the posterior anomaly score is computed for each edge based on sketch-derived statistics.

Dynamic Thresholding with EWMA and FPR Control LetX t=Score(u, v, t)denote the anomaly score for edge (u, v)at timet. To mitigate noisy fluctuations and control false positives in edge streams, we apply an adaptive thresholding mechanism based on the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) [9]. The smoothed anomaly signalZ tis recursively defined as: Zt=λX t+ (1−λ)Z t−1, λ∈(0,1],(20) whereλ∈(0,1]controls the memory decay; larger values assign more weight to recent anomalies. The initial value is set asZ 0=X 1. To adaptively estimate the decision boundary, we compute the empirical meanµ tand standard deviationσ tof the past scores up to timet, where: µt=1 ttX i=1Xi, σ2 t=1 ttX i=1(Xi−µt)2(21) The dynamic thresholdτ tis then defined as: τt=µt+k·σ t,(22) wherekis a sensitivity multiplier. a) Detection Rule.:An edge is flagged as anomalous at timetif: Xt> τt,(23) whereX t=Score(u, v, t)denotes the anomaly score for edge (u, v)at timet. b) False Positive Guarantee.:Using Chebyshev’s inequality [19], the probability of false alarm is bounded as: FPR t≤1 k2(24) The statistical guarantee in Equation 24 provides an upper bound on false positive rates, even under non-Gaussian noise.

Assume that the distribution ofX tis unimodal, has finite variance, and is approximately stationary over short windows. Then, the adaptive thresholding rule τt=µt+k·σ t ensures that the false positive rate (FPR) at timetis bounded by the tail probability of the underlying distribution: FPR t≤Pr(X t> µt+k·σ t).(25) Proof.We apply Chebyshev’s inequality [19] to the anomaly scoreX t, which has empirical meanµ tand standard deviation σtcomputed up to timet. For anyk >0, Chebyshev’s inequality guarantees: Pr(|X t−µt| ≥k·σ t)≤1 k2.(26) Since the detection rule only flags anomalies whenX t> τt=µt+k·σ t, the relevant tail probability is: Pr(X t> µt+k·σ t)≤1 k2.(27)Therefore, the likelihood of falsely classifying a normal edge as anomalous is bounded by: Pr(False Positive)≤1 k2.(28) This result holds regardless of the exact shape of the distribution, provided it is unimodal and has finite variance. For instance, ifk= 2, thenFPR t≤0.25; and ifk= 3, then FPR t≤0.11. G. Runtime and Output Tracking Finally, each detected anomaly is logged as: (u, v, t,Score uvt)if Score uvt> τt, where Score uvtdenotes the computed anomaly score for edge (u, v)at timet. LetN=|E|be the total number of edges processed in the stream. The average processing time per edge is computed as: AvgTime=Texec N,(29) whereT execis the total execution time for the entire stream. This completes the pipeline of ADAPTIVEGRAPHSKETCH, enabling scalable and low-latency anomaly detection in high-velocity edge streams. V. EXPERIMENTS We now evaluate ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHfor near real-time anomaly detection in dynamic graphs. The evaluation focuses on three key aspects: accuracy (ROC-AUC), runtime efficiency, and scalability across diverse graph structures. TABLE III DATASET STATISTICS.

B. Experimental Setup Experiments are conducted on a 13thGen Intel Core i9-13900 CPU (24 cores, 5.6 GHz), 32GB RAM, running Ubuntu 22.04. ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, implemented in C++, is compared against state-of-the-art baselines: DENSESTREAM[2], SEDANSPOT[10], MIDAS-R [1], PENMINER[11], F-FADE [6], and ANOEDGE-G/L [12], using their public implementations. Metric:We report Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and runtime. AUC is calculated by plotting true positive rate (TPR) vs. false positive rate (FPR) at various thresholds and measuring the area under the curve.ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHapplies a temporal tensor sketch with decay and EWMA smoothing. Sketch parameters includes:r∈[2,10]rows,c∈[10,1300]columns (e.g., c= 10for DARPA,800for ISCX,1300for CIC-DDoS2019). Decayγ∈[0.95,0.99], step sizeδ∈[10.0,15.0], EWMA α∈[0.65,0.95]depending on burst intensity, where lowerα values are used for burst-heavy traffic (e.g., DDoS2019) to empahsize recent changes, while higherαvalues (up to0.95) stabilizes scoring on datasets with steadier flow e.g., DARPA. All experiments are repeated 5 times, and we report the average of the ROC-AUC and I/O runtimes in order to mitigate the effect of hash randomization. C. Accuracy Table IV presents the ROC-AUC and runtime of ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHcompared to the established baselines across four benchmark datasets. Detection Performance:ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH demonstrates strong and consistent anomaly detection results across all four benchmarks, with AUC scores of 0.9568 (DARPA), 0.8761 (ISCX-IDS2012), 0.9923 (CIC-IDS2018), and 0.9993 (CIC-DDoS2019). While not the top performer on DARPA and ISCX-IDS2012, where ANOEDGE-G/L achieve slightly higher AUC, our method offers superior overall efficiency and outperforms all baselines on real-time, large-scale datasets (CIC-IDS2018 and CIC-DDoS2019), with the advantage of balancing high accuracy and low runtime. Compared to MIDAS-R, our model improves AUC by 1% (DARPA), 22% (ISCX), 12% (CIC-IDS2018), and 4% (CIC-DDoS2019). Against F-FADE, it outperforms by 4.3%, 71.8%, 17.7%, and 566% respectively. Compared to SEDANSPOT, we observe significant performance of 49.3% (DARPA), 51% (ISCX), 190.7% (CIC-IDS2018), and 76% (CIC-DDoS2019). PENMINER, while achieving reasonable AUC (e.g., 0.872 on DARPA, 0.821 on CIC-IDS2018), incurs extreme computational overhead (24+ hours on CIC-DDoS2019). Due to this limitation (reported in [11] and confirmed in our trials), we adopt its AUC values from the ANOEDGEbenchmark [12]. In contrast, our model outperforms PENMINERin accuracy on all datasets (9.7% on DARPA, 6.9% on CIC-IDS2018, and 34% on ISCX-IDS2012), and completes in less",

In contrast, our model outperforms PENMINERin accuracy on all datasets (9.7% on DARPA, 6.9% on CIC-IDS2018, and 34% on ISCX-IDS2012), and completes in less than 10 seconds. ANOEDGE-G performs well (e.g., 0.970 on DARPA), but suffers from high latency (up to 92 seconds on CIC-DDoS2019), while ANOEDGE-L is faster, it’s less stable, with lower AUC (e.g., 0.927 on CIC-IDS2018). Overall, our model consistently achieves higher AUC on 3 out of 4 datasets, demonstrating both precision and robustness. Running Time:Table IV reports model runtimes. Our method is up to36×fasterthan SEDANSPOTand at least5×fasterthan ANOEDGE-G, while maintaining comparable or higher accuracy. F-FADE shows severe training instability and degraded performance on large datasets, while DENSESTREAMis slower and less scalable in dense networks. PENMINERtook over 24 hours on CIC-DDoS2019, making it impractical for real-time use. Overall, our model offers a better speed–accuracy trade-off, enabling real-time anomaly detection in high-velocity edge streams. D. AUC vs. Running Time To highlight the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, Figure 4 plots AUC against runtime (log scale, seconds) on four datasets. ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHconsistently achieves the highest AUC with much lower runtime. Compared to traditional baselines (e.g., MIDAS-R, SedanSpot, F-FADE), it is both faster and more accurate, and it outperforms or matches recent methods (e.g., AnoEdge-G, AnoEdge-L), 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 Number of Edges0.0010.010.11.010.0Running Time (s)0.469s 0.465s 0.519s 0.486sDARPA ISCX-IDS2012 CIC-IDS2018 CIC-DDoS2019 slope = 1Fig. 5.Scalability of Adaptive-GraphSketch with Number of Edges.

Scalability and Robustness We evaluate ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHscalability on four datasets. Figure 5 shows runtime (seconds) as edge volume grows from10to106on a log-log scale. A slope-1reference line is included to benchmark linear growth. ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHscales near-linearly, processing 1M edges in under0.52s(0.469s DARPA, 0.464s ISCX, 0.519s CIC-IDS2018, 0.486s CIC-DDoS2019), confirming our model’s efficiency under both light and high-volume. 2 4 6 8 10 Number of Hash Functions0.10.51.02.03.04.0Running Time (s) 0.85s 0.22s1.61s3.36sDARPA (4.5M) ISCX2012 (1.1M) IDS2018 (7.9M) DDoS2019 (20.3M) Fig. 6.Scalability of ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHwith Varying Hash Functions.Runtime performance is evaluated on four datasets: DARPA (4.5M), ISCX2012 (1.1M), IDS2018 (7.9M), and DDoS2019 (20.3M). Each curve plots total processing time as the number of hash rows increases from 2 to 10. Final runtimes atr= 10are annotated beside the respective markers. We further examine runtime sensitivity to the number of hash functions, a key parameter in sketch-based models. As shown in Figure 6, increasing hash rows from 2 to 10 results in steady, linear runtime growth. Even at full dataset size (e.g., 20.3M edges for DDoS2019), processing remains efficient and completes in just3.36swith 10 hashes.

    "20.3M edges for DDoS2019), processing remains efficient and completes in just3.36swith 10 hashes. This validates the robustness and scalability of our sketch design under increasing sketch complexity. F . Efficiency Analysis The efficiency of ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHstems from its lightweight design that avoids costly operations. Unlike conventional methods such as random walks [3], and matrix factorizations [5], our method performs constant-time operations per edge. Each edge is processed inconstant timevia Count-Min Sketch with conservative updates [8], and performsmulti-sketch tensors, where sketches are stored as compact time–protocol tensors to preserve temporal granularity while conserving memory. Furthermore, anomaly scores are smoothed usingBayesian exponential moving averagesfor stability under dynamic patterns. Combined with CPU-level vectorization and pruning, these elements enable real-time detection with linear scalability, as confirmed by the results in Figures 5 and 6. VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we presented ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a real-time anomaly detection framework that leverages tensor-based sketching and Bayesian smoothing for detecting edge-level anomalies in dynamic graphs. By integrating Count-Min Sketch with conservative updates, exponential decay, and EWMA-based aggregation, our method achieves robust detection with sub-second latency and low memory overhead. Experiments across four real-world intrusion detection benchmark datasets show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCHoutperforms state-of-the-art streaming baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, PENMINERand F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing up to 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds with 10 hashes. Unlike matrix factorization or random walk-based methods, our approach supports constant-time edge updates and scales linearly with edge volume and sketch complexity, making it suitable for edge computing and real-time applications. Future work includes extending the framework for multi-modal anomaly detection with content-aware sketches. We also aim to optimize runtime via parallelization and hardware acceleration, while addressing temporal drift and heterogeneity in evolving networks.
