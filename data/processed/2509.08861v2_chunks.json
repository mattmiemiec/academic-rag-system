    "NORMALIZED DERIVATIONS FOR MILNOR’S PRIMITIVE OPERATIONS ON THE DICKSON ALGEBRA AND APPLICATIONS D-Ă.NG VÕ PHÚC∗ Abstract.Our work investigates the action of primitive Milnor operationsSt∆ion the Dick- son algebraD noverF p, building upon a foundational formula by Nguyen Sum [5]. Our central contribution is the introduction of a normalized operator,δ i, by factoring out the ubiquitous invariantQ n,0. This normalization transformsSt∆iinto a true derivation on the localized Dickson algebra, thereby establishing an elegant differential framework. This framework yields two new significant results: first, a closed-form formula for all higher iterates of the operator, revealing a strong factorial-based vanishing criterion for iterates of order≥p. Second, the discovery of a normalized coordinate system where the action has constant coefficients. This latter insight reduces the problem of computing the associated Margolis homology to a stan- dard Koszul complex computation, in direct analogy with a recent result by Ngo Anh Tuan [6]. As further consequences, we also construct a large family of kernel elements and describe the global structure of the action. Keywords:Dickson invariants, Steenrod algebra, Milnor operations, Modular invariant theory, Derivation, Margolis homology, Koszul homology. MSC (2020):55S10, 13A50, 55N99. 1.Introduction Letpbe a prime andP n=F p[x1,...,x n]be the polynomial algebra with its naturalGL n(Fp)- action. The Dickson invariantsQ n,0,Qn,1,...,Q n,n−1generate a polynomial subalgebraD n, known as the Dickson algebra [1], that plays a central role in invariant theory and algebraic topology. Its importance is particularly pronounced in the study of the cohomology of ele- mentary abelianp-groups, whereD nappears as the ring of invariants under the action of the Steenrod algebra,A p. A fundamental problem, therefore, is to determine the structure ofD n as a module overA p. Milnor’s primitive operations [4], denoted here bySt∆i, are key components of the Steenrod algebra and act onP nas graded derivations. In a foundational paper [5], N. Sum provided an explicit closed formula for the action ofSt∆ion each Dickson generatorQ n,s. Sum’s identity expresses this action in the form St∆i(Qn,s) = (−1)nQn,0/parenleftbigg Pp n,i,s+Rp n,iQn,s/parenrightbigg , where the coefficientsP n,i,sandR n,iare themselves explicit polynomials in the Dickson invari- ants. While useful, this formula’s recurring factor ofQ n,0makes calculations of higher iterates cumbersome and obscures the underlying algebraic mechanics. The main goal of this paper is to show that, through an appropriate algebraic normalization, the complex action ofSt∆ican be reduced to that of a classical derivation. Our new contributions are twofold as follows: •A closed-form formula for iterates.We derive an explicit expression for them-th iterate(St∆i)mon any Dickson generator. This formula reveals a surprising connection to the factorialm!and provides a strong and simple vanishing criterion: the action is always zero form≥p. •A constant-coefficient structure and its application.We show that in a system of normalized coordinatesR s:=Q n,s/Qn,0, the operatorSt∆iacts withconstant coefficients.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 collects the necessary preliminaries on Dickson invariants and states the main results in detail. Section 3 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Finally, Section 4 applies this framework to compute the Dickson-Milnor Margolis homology, demonstrating the utility of the constant-coefficient perspective. 2.Main theoretical results Let[e 1,...,e n]denote the Dickson-type determinants. Put Ln= [0,1,...,n−1], L n,s= [0,1,..., /hatwides,...,n] (0≤s<n). The Dickson invariants are defined inFrac(P n)by Qn,s=Ln,s Ln(0≤s<n), Q n,0=Lp−1 n. LetD n=F p[Qn,0,...,Q n,n−1]. Throughout we fixi >1and letSt∆idenote the corresponding Milnor primitive acting on Pn; it satisfies the Cartan (Leibniz) formula. The paper [5] establishes the following identity, which will be our sole external input: Theorem 2.1([5]).For everys∈{0,...,n−1}there exist explicit elementsP n,i,s,Rn,i∈D n (given in terms of Dickson-type determinants) withP n,i,0= 0such that St∆i(Qn,s) = (−1)nQn,0/parenleftbigg Pp n,i,s+Rp n,iQn,s/parenrightbigg . We now build upon this foundational result. Our main strategy is to normalize the operator St∆ito reveal its underlying structure as a classical derivation, from which we will deduce several new structural and computational results. (A) The Normalized Derivation.Theorem2.1showsthattheactionofSt∆ionanyDickson generator produces a factor ofQ n,0. This motivates the following normalization. Proposition 2.2(The Normalized Operator as a Derivation).On the localizationD n[Q−1 n,0], the operator δi:= (−1)nQ−1 n,0St∆i:D n[Q−1 n,0]−→D n[Q−1 n,0] is a well-definedF p–linear derivation. Its values on the Dickson generators are given by δi(Qn,s) =Pp n,i,s+Rp n,iQn,s. In particular, for anyF∈D n[Q−1 n,0],δi(Fp) = 0and henceSt∆i(Fp) = 0. Sinceδ iis a derivation, it must satisfy the chain rule. This provides a practical algorithm for computing the action ofSt∆ion any polynomial in the Dickson invariants. Remark 2.3(Chain rule for the action ofSt∆i).Letf∈F p[X0,...,X n−1]and writeQ = (Qn,0,...,Q n,n−1). Becauseδ iis a derivation (Proposition 2.2), its action onf(Q )is de- termined by its action on the generators via the formal chain rule. Translating back to St∆i= (−1)nQn,0δi, we obtain the explicit formula: St∆i/parenleftig f(Q)/parenrightig = (−1)nQn,0n−1/summationdisplay s=0∂f ∂Xs(Q)/parenleftig Pp n,i,s+Rp n,iQn,s/parenrightig .

Fors∈{0,1,...,n−1} setA s:=Pp n,i,sandB:=Rp n,i.Then, for every integerm≥1, (A.1) δm i(Qn,s) =BmQn,s+Bm−1As and (A.2) (St∆i)m(Qn,s) = (−1)mnm!Qm n,0/parenleftbigg BmQn,s+Bm−1As/parenrightbigg . Herem!is the factorial ofm. It arises from the identity/summationtextm k=0/bracketleftigg m k/bracketrightigg =m!, where/bracketleftigg m k/bracketrightigg denotes the (unsigned) Stirling numbers of the first kind. Corollary 2.5.For allm≥1ands, one has that(St∆i)m(Qn,s)belongs to the principal ideal (Qm n,0). Moreover,(St∆i)m(Qn,s) = 0for allm≥p. Remark 2.6.Corollary 2.5 generalizes the familiarm= 1case. The new vanishing criterion is much stronger, providing a simple condition based on the primepfor all higher iterates to vanish identically. Example 2.7(Efficiency of the Closed-Form Formula).To illustrate the usefulness of Theorem 2.4, consider the task of computing the third iterate,(St∆i)3(Qn,s). Method 1: Using the Closed-Form Formula.Applying formula (A.2) from Theorem 2.4 for m= 3is a direct substitution: (St∆i)3(Qn,s) = (−1)3n3!Q3 n,0/parenleftbigg B3Qn,s+B2As/parenrightbigg = (−1)n·6·Q3 n,0/parenleftbigg B3Qn,s+B2As/parenrightbigg .

    "the usefulness of Theorem 2.4, consider the task of computing the third iterate,(St∆i)3(Qn,s). Method 1: Using the Closed-Form Formula.Applying formula (A.2) from Theorem 2.4 for m= 3is a direct substitution: (St∆i)3(Qn,s) = (−1)3n3!Q3 n,0/parenleftbigg B3Qn,s+B2As/parenrightbigg = (−1)n·6·Q3 n,0/parenleftbigg B3Qn,s+B2As/parenrightbigg . The result is obtained in a single, error-free step. Method 2: Direct Iterative Calculation.A direct computation without Theorem 2.4 requires sequentially applying the operatorSt∆i. •Step 1 (m= 1):We start with the base formula from Theorem 2.1: St∆i(Qn,s) = (−1)nQn,0(As+BQ n,s). •Step 2 (m= 2):To find the second iterate, one must applySt∆ito the expression above. This requires using the Leibniz rule on the product ofQ n,0and(A s+BQ n,s), which already splits the calculation into multiple complex terms. •Step 3 (m= 3):ApplyingSt∆iathirdtimetotheresultofStep 2leadstoacombinatorial explosion of terms, each requiring careful application of the Leibniz rule. The fundamental difficulty is that the multiplication operator byQ n,0and the normalized derivationδ ido not commute. This non-commutativity is the source of the combinatorial complexity. Our proof of Theorem 2.4 (particularly Proposition 3.2 in Section 3 involving Stirling numbers) is precisely the machinery designed to systematically manage this complexity. Conclusion.The closed-form formula is not merely a computational shortcut; it is the explicit resolution of the combinatorial problem inherent in the iterative application ofSt∆i. It trans- forms a lengthy, error-prone, and combinatorially complex task into a simple substitution. (B) Kernel, Image, and Invariant Coordinates.The derivation framework also allows for a systematic study of the kernel and image ofSt∆i. Proposition 2.8(Kernel Family).For allF(Q )∈D nand alls∈{0,...,n−1}, St∆i/parenleftig Qp−1 n,0F(Q)pQn,s/parenrightig = (−1)nQp n,0/parenleftig F(Q)Pn,i,s/parenrightigp, and the resulting element on the right-hand side lies inker(St∆i). 4 D -Ă.NG VÕ PHÚC∗ Remark 2.9.Proposition 2.8 is a direct generalization of a result from [5]. Indeed, in the special case whereF(Q )is the constant polynomial1, it immediately yields Corollary 2.8 of Sum’s paper [5]. Corollary 2.10(Global Properties of the Action).The operatorSt∆ihas the following prop- erties onD n: (i)Image Containment:Im(St∆i)⊆(Q n,0), the principal ideal generated byQ n,0. (ii)Annihilated Ideal:IfD(p) nis the Frobenius image ofD n, thenSt∆ivanishes on the idealQp n,0·D(p) n. Proposition 2.11(Invariant Ratios).Work in the localizationD n[Q−1 n,0]. LetA s:=Pp n,i,sand B:=Rp n,i. If we further work in a localization whereBis invertible, then for eachs, the element Is:=Qn,s+B−1As Qn,0 is in the kernel of the normalized derivation, i.e.,δ i(Is) = 0. Consequently, any polynomial Φ(I 0,...,I n−1)is in the kernel ofSt∆i. Theorem 2.12(Action on Normalized Dickson Ratios).Work in the localizationD n[Q−1 n,0]. In the coordinate system defined by the ratios Rs:=Qn,s Qn,0, s= 0,1,...,n−1, the action ofSt∆isimplifies to that of a first-order differential operator with constant coeffi- cients. Specifically, letA s:=Pp n,i,s. Then (B.1) St∆i/parenleftig Rs/parenrightig = (−1)nAs and, for every polynomial (or rational function)Φ = Φ(R 0,...,R n−1), (B.2) St∆i/parenleftig Φ(R)/parenrightig = (−1)nn−1/summationdisplay s=0∂Φ ∂Rs(R)A s Remark 2.13(Relation to invariant ratios and kernel).The invariant ratios of Proposition 2.11 can be expressed in theR scoordinates asI s=R s+B−1As Qn,0. A direct calculation using the proof of Theorem 2.12 shows thatδ i(Rs) =A s/Qn,0whileδ i(B−1As/Qn,0) =−A s/Qn,0, which re-confirms thatδ i(Is) = 0. This clarifies the connection between the kernel construction and the constant-coefficient coordinate system. 3.Proofs Proof",

A direct calculation using the proof of Theorem 2.12 shows thatδ i(Rs) =A s/Qn,0whileδ i(B−1As/Qn,0) =−A s/Qn,0, which re-confirms thatδ i(Is) = 0. This clarifies the connection between the kernel construction and the constant-coefficient coordinate system. 3.Proofs Proof of Proposition 2.2.The fact thatSt∆iis a derivation onP nthat stabilizesD nimplies it extends uniquely to the localizationD n[Q−1 n,0]. The Leibniz rule forδ ifollows directly from that ofSt∆i: δi(fg) = (−1)nQ−1 n,0/parenleftig St∆i(f)g+fSt∆i(g)/parenrightig =δi(f)g+fδ i(g). Theformulaforδ i(Qn,s)isadirectconsequenceofsubstitutingTheorem2.1intothedefinitionof δi. Finally,thepropertyδ i(Fp) =pFp−1δi(F) = 0isstandardforanyderivationincharacteristic p. □ MILNOR OPERATIONS AND NORMALIZED DERIVATIONS 5 Proof of Theorem 2.4.From Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 2.2, we have δi(Qn,s) =A s+BQ n,s, δ i(Qn,0) =BQ n,0. Sinceδ i(Qn,s) =A s+BQ n,sandδ i(As) =δ i(B) = 0in characteristicp, a direct induction on mgives (A.1). Indeed, clearly (A.1) holds form= 1. Assume (A.1) is true for some integerk≥1: δk i(Qn,s) =BkQn,s+Bk−1As. Then δk+1 i(Qn,s) =δ i(BkQn,s+Bk−1As) =Bkδi(Qn,s) +δ i(Bk−1As) =Bk(As+BQ n,s) + 0 =BkAs+Bk+1Qn,s. Thus (A.1) also holds fork+ 1, and therefore, (A.1) is proven for allm≥1. We now prove (A.2). Our goal is to find a closed form for(St∆i)m(Qn,s). We start with the relationSt∆i= (−1)nQn,0δi, which implies(St∆i)m= (−1)mn(Qn,0δi)m. The main challenge is to compute(Q n,0δi)m, as the operators do not commute. To do this rigorously, we first establish two intermediate results. Lemma 3.1.LetMbe the operator of multiplication byQ n,0. Then, the operatorsδ iandM satisfy the generalized relation for any integerm≥1: δiMm=Mm(δi+mB),withB=Rp n,i. Proof.We proceed by induction onm. Form= 1,we apply both sides to an arbitrary function f. The left-hand side gives: δiM(f) =δ i(Qn,0·f) = (δ i(Qn,0))·f+Q n,0·δi(f)(by Leibniz rule) = (BQ n,0)·f+Q n,0·δi(f)(by (A.1)). The right-hand side gives: (M(δ i+B))(f) =M(δ i(f) +B·f) =Q n,0·(δi(f) +B·f) = (Q n,0B)·f+Q n,0·δi(f) =δ iM(f)(sinceBandQ n,0commute). Thus, the lemma holds form= 1. Assume the lemma holds for some integerm=k≥1,i.e.δ iMk=Mk(δi+kB).We prove that the formula also holds form=k+ 1. We start with the left-hand side: δiMk+1=M(δ i+B)Mk =M/parenleftig Mk(δi+kB) +BMk/parenrightig (by the inductive hypothesis) =Mk+1(δi+kB) +BMk+1(sinceBandMcommute) =Mk+1δi+ (k+ 1)Mk+1B =Mk+1(δi+ (k+ 1)B). This is the required formula form=k+ 1. The lemma follows.□ Proposition 3.2.Letδ iandMbe operators satisfying the relationδ iM=M(δ i+B)for some Bwhereδ i(B) = 0.

Indeed, we have (Mδ i)m+1=Mδ i Mmm/summationdisplay j=1/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg Bm−jδj i (by the inductive hypothesis) =M(Mm(δi+mB)) m/summationdisplay j=1/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg Bm−jδj i (by Lemma 3.1) =Mm+1(δi+mB)m/summationdisplay j=1/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg Bm−jδj i =Mm+1 m/summationdisplay j=1/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg Bm−jδj+1 i+m/summationdisplay j=1m/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg Bm−j+1δj i . To simplify this expression, we re-index the sums so they can be combined. Letk=j+ 1in the first sum (soj=k−1) andk=jin the second sum. The first sum becomes:/summationtextm+1 k=2/bracketleftigg m k−1/bracketrightigg Bm−(k−1)δk i=/summationtextm+1 k=2/bracketleftigg m k−1/bracketrightigg Bm+1−kδk i. The second sum becomes:/summationtextm k=1m/bracketleftigg m k/bracketrightigg Bm+1−kδk i. Now, we add them together. The coefficient of the general termMm+1Bm+1−kδk iis the sum of the coefficients from both sums: coeff(δk i) =/parenleftigg/bracketleftigg m k−1/bracketrightigg/parenrightigg +/parenleftigg m/bracketleftigg m k/bracketrightigg/parenrightigg . This is precisely the recurrence relation for the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind: /bracketleftigg m+ 1 k/bracketrightigg =/bracketleftigg m k−1/bracketrightigg +m/bracketleftigg m k/bracketrightigg . Verification of boundary cases:The recurrence holds for the full range ofk. Fork= 1, it gives/bracketleftigg m+ 1 1/bracketrightigg =/bracketleftigg m 0/bracketrightigg +m/bracketleftigg m 1/bracketrightigg , which simplifies to the identitym! = 0 +m·(m−1)!. Fork=m+ 1, it gives/bracketleftigg m+ 1 m+ 1/bracketrightigg =/bracketleftigg m m/bracketrightigg +m/bracketleftigg m m+ 1/bracketrightigg , which simplifies to the identity1 = 1 +m·0. Substituting this back, our expression becomes: (Mδ i)m+1=Mm+1m+1/summationdisplay k=1/bracketleftigg m+ 1 k/bracketrightigg Bm+1−kδk i. This is precisely the formula form+ 1. The proof of the proposition is complete.□ MILNOR OPERATIONS AND NORMALIZED DERIVATIONS 7 We now apply these results to find(St∆i)m(Qn,s). Indeed, we have (St∆i)m(Qn,s) = (−1)mn(Qn,0δi)m(Qn,s) = (−1)mn Qm n,0m/summationdisplay j=1/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg Bm−jδj i (Qn,s)(by Proposition 3.2) = (−1)mnQm n,0m/summationdisplay j=1/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg Bm−j(δj i(Qn,s)). We substitute the result forδj i(Qn,s)from (A.1) and obtain: (St∆i)m(Qn,s) = (−1)mnQm n,0m/summationdisplay j=1/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg (BmQn,s+Bm−1As) = (−1)mnQm n,0m/summationdisplay j=0/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg (BmQn,s+Bm−1As)(since/bracketleftigg m 0/bracketrightigg = 0) = (−1)mnm!Qm n,0(BmQn,s+Bm−1As)(sincem/summationdisplay j=0/bracketleftigg m j/bracketrightigg =m!) This completes the proof of (A.2).□ Remark 3.3.While formula (A.2) can also be established by a direct, albeitcomputationally complicated, induction onm, the proof presented above is chosen for conceptual clarity. Our operator-theoretic approach is designed to elucidate the combinatorial structure underlying the iteration, explaining precisely how the non-commutativity of operators gives rise to the factorial termm!via Stirling numbers. Proof of Proposition 2.8.ApplythechainrulefromRemark2.3tothepolynomialf(X 0,...,X n−1) = Xp−1 0/parenleftig F(X 0,...,X n−1)/parenrightigpXs. The only non-zero partial derivatives in characteristicpare for t= 0andt=s. This gives St∆i/parenleftig Qp−1 n,0F(Q)pQn,s/parenrightig = (p−1)Qp−2 n,0F(Q)pQn,sSt∆i(Qn,0) +Qp−1 n,0F(Q)pSt∆i(Qn,s). Using Theorem 2.1 and noting(p−1)≡−1 (modp), we get St∆i/parenleftig Qp−1 n,0F(Q)pQn,s/parenrightig = (−1)n/bracketleftbigg −Qp−2 n,0FpQn,s(Rp n,iQ2 n,0) +Qp−1 n,0FpQn,0(Pp n,i,s+Rp n,iQn,s)/bracketrightbigg = (−1)nQp n,0Fp/parenleftbigg −Rp n,iQn,s+Pp n,i,s+Rp n,iQn,s/parenrightbigg = (−1)nQp n,0(FP n,i,s)p. By Proposition 2.2,St∆i(Gp) = 0for anyG, hence the right-hand side lies inker(St∆i).□ Proof of Corollary 2.10.(i) The image containment follows from Remark 2.3, as every value St∆i(f(Q ))is a sum of terms each containing a factor ofQ n,0.

SinceA sandBarep-th powers, δi(As) =δ i(B) = 0. This givesδ i(B−1As) = 0. Using Proposition 2.2, we compute: δi(Us) =δ i(Qn,s) +δ i(B−1As) =A s+BQ n,s+ 0 =B(B−1As+Q n,s) =B·U s. Now we apply the quotient rule for derivations toI s=U s/Qn,0: δi(Is) =δi(Us)Qn,0−U sδi(Qn,0) Q2 n,0=(B·U s)Qn,0−U s(BQ n,0) Q2 n,0= 0. The final claim follows from the chain rule (Remark 2.3).□ Proof of Theorem 2.12.By Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 2.2, we haveδ i(Qn,s) =A s+BQ n,s andδ i(Qn,0) =BQ n,0.

HenceSt∆i(Rs) = (−1)nQn,0δi(Rs) = (−1)nAs= (−1)nPp n,i,s, which is (B.1).

This completes the proof of (B.2), and the theorem. □ 4.An application to the Margolis homology In this section, we explain how the normalized–derivation viewpoint streamlines the compu- tation of Margolis homology in the sense of the recent work of Tuan [6]. 4.1.A short re-derivation via the Koszul complex.We first recall the main result from Tuan’s work [6].

Let Rn:=E(x 1,...,x n)⊗P(y 1,...,y n, Vn+1) and letQ jbe thej-th Milnor primitive (cohomological degree2pj−1) acting by the Cartan formula with Qj(xs) =ypj s, Q j(ys) = 0, Q j(Vi) = 0 (1≤s≤n, i≥1)(see [6, Lemma 2.1]). MILNOR OPERATIONS AND NORMALIZED DERIVATIONS 9 Thus, if we regardE(x 1,...,x n)as the exterior factor andP(y,V)as the polynomial factor, thenQ jis exactly the Koszul differential determined by the sequence a(j)= (a(j) 1,...,a(j) n) := (ypj 1,...,ypj n)∈P(y 1,...,y n, Vn+1). Since this is a regular sequence in the polynomial factor, standard Koszul homology theory immediately yields the result. Theorem 4.1 can therefore be re-phrased in terms of Koszul homology as follows: Theorem 4.3.The sequencea(j)isP(y,V)-regular. Consequently, the Koszul complex /parenleftig E(x 1,...,x n)⊗P(y,V), d:=Q j/parenrightig , d(x s) =ypj s, d| P(y,V) = 0, has homology H∗/parenleftig Rn, Qj/parenrightig∼=P(y 1,...,y n, Vn+1)/slashig /parenleftig ypj 1,...,ypj n/parenrightig , concentrated in exterior degree0. Proof.The variablesy 1,...,y nform a polynomial system of parameters, hence a regular se- quence; powers of a regular sequence remain regular. The Koszul complexK(a(j);P(y,V))∼= (E(x)⊗P(y,V),d)computes the Tor overP(y,V)with respect toP(y,V)/(a(j)), soH 0∼= P(y,V)/(a(j))andH >0=",

The present proof reduces those combinatorics to the regular-sequence property. 4.2.A constant-coefficient principle for Milnor-type differentials.We now record the generalmechanismthatwewillinvokefortheDickson-Milnorapplication. LetR=F p[R0,...,R n−1] be a polynomialF p-algebra, fix elementsc 0,...,c n−1∈R, and consider the graded algebra E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗Requipped with the degree-−1differential d(ξs) =c s, d| R= 0, extended to all ofE(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗Rby the graded Leibniz rule. Proposition 4.5(Constant-coefficient Koszul principle).If(c 0,...,c n−1)is anR-regular se- quence, then H∗/parenleftig E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗R, d/parenrightig∼=R/(c 0,...,c n−1), concentrated in exterior degree0. Proof.This is the standard identification of the differential graded (graded-commutative)F p- algebra(E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗R,d)with the Koszul complexK(c 0,...,c n−1;R).□ 4.3.Dickson-Milnor application in normalized coordinates.Recall from Theorem 2.12 that on the polynomialF p-algebraF p[R0,...,R n−1], the operatorSt∆iacts as the first-order differential operator with constant coefficients. This puts us precisely in the scope of Proposi- tion 4.5. We first need the following result: Proposition 4.6(GenericregularsequenceviatheJacobian).Letk=F pandR=k[R 0,...,R n−1]. Fix polynomialsA 0,...,A n−1∈Rand write J(R) := det/parenleftbigg∂As ∂Rt/parenrightbigg 0≤s,t≤n−1∈R. IfJ̸≡0, then on the principal open setD(J) = SpecR Jthe sequenceA 0,...,A n−1isR J– regular (equivalently, the idealA:= (A 0,...,A n−1)has heightninR J). In particular, the Koszul complexK •(A;R J)is exact, soH i/parenleftig K•(A;R J)/parenrightig = 0for alli>0andH 0/parenleftig K•(A;R J)/parenrightig∼= RJ/AR J. 10 D -Ă.NG VÕ PHÚC∗ Indeed, by the Jacobian criterion [3], the closed subschemeV(A)∩D(J)has codimensionn. In a regular ring, an ideal of heightngenerated bynelements is a complete intersection; hence (A0,...,A n−1)is a regular sequence and the Koszul complex is exact [2]. Remark 4.7. (i) If one works with more generators than variables, the same conclusion holds after re- placingJby the product of alln×nminors of the Jacobian matrix. (ii) In our application,A s=Pp n,i,sare polynomials in the coordinatesR t. The localization RJwithJ= det(∂A s/∂R t)providesanaturalZariskiopendomainwhere(A 0,...,A n−1) is a regular sequence, so the associated Koszul complex computes homology byH •∼= H•/parenleftig K•(A;R J)/parenrightig withH >0= 0andH 0∼=RJ/(A). (iii) IfJ≡0, one may still obtain a nonempty open set of regularity by inverting a nonzero n×nminor of the Jacobian at which the rank isn, whenever such a minor exists. Theorem 4.8(Dickson-Milnor Margolis homology inR-coordinates).Work inD n[Q−1 n,0]and setA s:=Pp n,i,s(0≤s≤n−1). Consider the differential graded algebra /parenleftig E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗F p[R0,...,R n−1], di/parenrightig , d i(ξs) = (−1)nAs, d i|Fp[R0,...,R n−1]= 0. If the sequence(A 0,...,A n−1)is regular inR(or after localizing at a multiplicative set, e.g. at the Jacobian determinantJ= det(∂A s/∂R t)so that it becomes regular inR J), then H∗/parenleftig E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗F p[R0,...,R n−1], di/parenrightig∼=Fp[R0,...,R n−1]/slashig/parenleftig A0,...,A n−1/parenrightig , concentrated in exterior degree0. Proof.PutR:=F p[R0,...,R n−1].(We note that by Proposition 4.6, after localizing at the nonzero Jacobian determinantJ= det(∂A s/∂R t)the sequence(A 0,...,A n−1)isR J–regular. ReplacingRbyR J, we may apply Proposition 4.6.) By Theorem 2.12 we have the constant–",

Proof.PutR:=F p[R0,...,R n−1].(We note that by Proposition 4.6, after localizing at the nonzero Jacobian determinantJ= det(∂A s/∂R t)the sequence(A 0,...,A n−1)isR J–regular. ReplacingRbyR J, we may apply Proposition 4.6.) By Theorem 2.12 we have the constant– coefficient identities (*)St∆i(Rs) = (−1)nAs (0≤s≤n−1), and, more generally, for every polynomialΦ(R 0,...,R n−1)∈R, St∆i/parenleftig Φ(R 0,...,R n−1)/parenrightig = (−1)nn−1/summationdisplay s=0∂Φ ∂Rs(R0,...,R n−1)As. Thus the operator∂:= (−1)nSt∆irestricts to a first-order differential operator with constant coefficients onR: ∂(R s) =A s∈R(constants), ∂isF p-linear and satisfies the Leibniz rule onR. Nowconsiderthegraded-commutativeF p-algebraE(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗Randdefineadifferential diby di/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle R= 0, d i(ξs) = (−1)nAs, d i(ω·f) =d i(ω)·f+ (−1)|ω|ω·d i(f). BecauseA s∈Sandd i|R= 0, one immediately checksd2 i= 0on generators, hence on all of E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗R. Letc s:= (−1)nAsandc:= (c 0,...,c n−1). By construction the pair/parenleftig E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗R, d i/parenrightig is the Koszul complexK(c;R): K(c;R)∼=/parenleftig E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗R, d i/parenrightig , sinced i(ξs) =c sandd ivanishes onR. (Equivalently, (*) shows that∂evaluates to constants on the coordinate functionsR s, so the standard \"Koszul extension\" of∂is exactlyd i.) Assume that(A 0,...,A n−1)is a regular sequence inR(hence so is(c 0,...,c n−1)). Then the general Koszul theorem (stated here as Proposition 4.5) applies: Hq/parenleftig K(c;R)/parenrightig = 0 (q>0), H 0/parenleftig K(c;R)/parenrightig∼=R/(c 0,...,c n−1)∼=R/(A 0,...,A n−1). MILNOR OPERATIONS AND NORMALIZED DERIVATIONS 11 The second isomorphism uses that multiplying generators by the common sign(−1)ndoes not change the ideal they generate. Viewing(E(ξ)⊗S,d i)as the Koszul complex on(A 0,...,A n−1), we obtain H∗/parenleftig E(ξ 0,...,ξ n−1)⊗R, d i/parenrightig∼=R/(A 0,...,A n−1), concentrated in exterior degree0.□ Remark 4.9.Our new result for the Dickson algebra, Theorem 4.8, is a formally identical statement to the Koszul re-phrasing of Tuan’s work (Theorem 4.3) after the change of variables /parenleftig E(x)⊗P(y,V), Q j/parenrightig ←→/parenleftig E(ξ)⊗F p[R], d i/parenrightig , ypj s←→A s=Pp n,i,s. Tuan’s case has coefficientsc s=ypj s; our Dickson-Milnor case has coefficientsc s=A s, thanks to the normalized coordinatesR swhereSt∆ihas constant coefficients. 5.Conclusion This paper has introduced a normalized derivation framework for studying the action of Mil- nor’s primitive operations on the Dickson algebra. The primary contributions of this framework are twofold. First, it provides a closed-form expression for the higher iterates ofSt∆i, yield- ing a new and useful vanishing criterion (Theorem 2.4). This result transforms a previously cumbersome and combinatorially complex calculation into a direct substitution. Second, and more conceptually significant, this perspective uncovers a hidden constant-coefficient structure of the action when viewed in a normalized coordinate system (Theorem 2.12). This shows that it connects a specialized problem in algebraic topology to the standard theory of Koszul complexes, thereby simplifying the computation of the associated Margolis homology (Theorem 4.8).
