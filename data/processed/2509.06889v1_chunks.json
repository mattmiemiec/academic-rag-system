    "Unified Description for Reentrance andT cEnhancement in Ferromagnetic Superconductors Xusheng Wang,1,∗Lianyi He,1and Shuaihua Ji1, 2 1State Key Laboratory of Low-Dimensional Quantum Physics, Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China 2Frontier Science Center for Quantum Information, Beijing 100084, China (Dated: September 13, 2025) Ferromagnetic superconductors, where ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist despite their antagonism, exhibit strikingly diverse behaviors. Depending on the interplay between the ferromagnetic exchange field and the superconducting condensate, superconductivity may vary with temperature monotonically, non-monotonically, or even reentrantly, all of which can be tuned by external magnetic fields. Here, we present a unified theoretical framework and construct compre- hensive phase diagrams that capture these regimes and predict new phenomena, including double- reentrant superconductivity. We further demonstrate how magnetic fields drive systematic shifts between distinct temperature-dependent behaviors, thereby explaining recent experimental results and predicting new transitions. In addition, we show that the field-induced enhancement of super- conductivity, previously observed as a slight increase inT c, can under certain conditions become dramatic. Ferromagnetism, featured with a large exchange field, typically suppresses superconductivity once the field ex- ceeds the paramagnetic Pauli limitH p[1–4]. Neverthe- less, intrinsic ferromagnetic superconductors (FSC) have been discovered in heavy-fermion uranium and europium compounds [5–12], where the coexistence of these an- tagonistic orders gives rise to exotic reentrant phenom- ena and has become a central focus of recent research. Such reentrant superconductivity can be broadly divided into field-induced and temperature-induced types [13– 15]. The former is often explained by the Jaccarino-Peter effect [16], where an external magnetic field compensates the exchange field, thereby restoring superconductivity. The latter, in contrast, is only qualitatively attributed to magnetic phase transitions [17–19]. Experimentally, temperature-dependent behaviors of FSC fall into three distinct categories: (i) monotonic, where superconduc- tivity appears at low temperature and vanishes at higher temperatures [8, 20]; (ii) non-monotonic, where super- conductivity survives only in an intermediate tempera- ture range [12, 21, 22]; and (iii) reentrant, where super- conductivity persists at low temperatures, disappears at slightly higher temperatures, and reemerges upon fur- ther heating [20, 23]. Despite extensive efforts, a unified theory that accounts for these diverse behaviors remains absent. In this Letter, we analyze the superconducting state of FSC by incorporating a temperature-dependent ex- change field and constructing the phase diagram in the exchange-field-temperature plane. This framework suc- cessfully reproduces all experimentally observed types of temperature-dependent behaviors and further predicts two previously unreported reentrant regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that these behaviors are not fixed but can be transformed into one another by tuning an ex- ternal compensating magnetic field, providing a natu-ral explanation for several key experimental observations. Most strikingly, our analysis reveals that the supercon- ducting transition temperatureT c, which is only slightly enhanced by magnetic fields in previous experiments [24– 26], can under special conditions increase by up to a fac- tor of five. For a FSC, the ferromagnetic contribution can be ef- fectively described by an exchange fieldh exunder the assumption of weak coupling between magnetism and su- perconductivity [16, 27]. The Hamiltonian of the system is then written as ˆH=X k,σξ(k)ˆψ† σ(k)ˆψσ(k) +X k,σσhexˆψ† σ(k)ˆψσ(k) +X k,k′U(k,k′)ˆψ†",

Minimizing Ω yields ∆(h ex, T), from which the phase diagram can be mapped, with the super- conducting and normal states separated by the condition ∆(h ex, T) = 0. Importantly, the exchange field in a ferro- magnet itself exhibits a strong temperature dependence, which can be generally described as [28, 29]arXiv:2509.06889v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 8 Sep 2025 2 TABLE I.

Ifhexis treated as a temperature-independent parame- ter, theh ex-Tphase diagram is well established [3]. By plotting theh ex(T) curve on this phase diagram, finite temperature behavior of superconductivity can be dis- tinguished through its intersection with the phase tran- sition boundary. Remarkably, the three experimentally observed types of temperature dependence—monotonic, non-monotonic, and reentrant—can be uniformly under- stood within this framework by tuning the ferromagnetic parameterss,h ex(0), andT m, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Each superconducting type can be classified by the topological relation between the temperature-dependent exchange-field curve and the superconducting phase- transition line, as summarized in Table I. For mono- tonic type, the conditionh ex(0)< H pholds and the two curves intersect at no more than one point [Fig. 1(b)]. The non-monotonic type arises whenh ex(0)> H pand one or two intersections occur [Fig. 1(c)]. Most in- triguingly, temperature-induced reentrant superconduc- tivity emerges whenh ex(0)< H pand the curves inter- sect at two or three points [Fig. 1(d)]. The calculated temperature dependence of the gap amplitude repro- duces experimental results from resistance measurements [8, 10, 12, 20–23] and tunneling spectroscopy [30] (see SM for detailed comparisons). Notably, our model predicts unconventional non-monotonic gap variations with tem- perature [Figs.1(b-d)], which have not yet been observed due to the lack of systematic tunneling studies, but may be detectable in HoNi 2B2C or ErNi 2B2C [20].

Further- more, the order of the superconducting transition itself depends on temperature: it is first order at low tempera- tures, where the specific heat diverges, and second order at higher temperatures, where the specific heat shows a discontinuity. These two thermodynamic signatures are consistent with experimental observations on EuRh 4B4 and LuRh 4B4[22, 31] (see SM). To further elucidate the parameter dependence of temperature-related behaviors, we numerically calcu- lated the phase diagrams ofh ex(0) versusT mfor fixed (a) (b) (c) (d) FIG. 1.

In the calculation, the su- perconducting behaviors were classified as follows. Su- perconductivity was considered terminated when ∆< 10−4∆0and it was denoted as ‘N’, otherwise labeled as ‘S’. Compressing consecutive identical strings yields compact sequences (e.g., ‘S,N,···’ or ‘N,S,···’), which uniquely distinguish the different types of behavior. In this representation, monotonic, non-monotonic, and reentrant superconductivity correspond to ‘S-N’, ‘N-S-N’ and ‘S-N-S-N’ respectively. Beyond these, additional cat- egories emerge, such as ‘N’ for a fully nonsuperconduct- ing state, and more complex sequences like ‘N-S-N-S-N’ and ‘S-N-S-N-S-N’ which we identify as novel complex and double-reentrant behaviors that have not yet been experimentally observed. 3 TABLE II.

(d) Representative ∆(T) curves for the predicted double-reentrant and complex behaviors. As shown in the phase diagrams, at least five distinct temperature-related behaviors appear for all values of s, demonstrating the universality of the results derived from Eq. (3). Among them, the monotonic and non- monotonic regimes occupy the largest areas of parameter space, while the reentrant regime is comparatively small. This naturally explains why most FSC exhibit monotonic or non-monotonic behavior, whereas reentrant behavior is observed only in a few cases. Increasingsleads to a progressive shrinkage of the reentrant region, while the double-reentrant and complex phases gradually expand. Nevertheless, these latter regimes remain confined to very narrow regions of parameter space, consistent with the fact that they have not yet been experimentally identi- fied. It is also instructive to examine the intriguing double- reentrant and complex regimes. As illustrated by the phase diagram and ∆(T) curves in Fig. 2(d), these be- haviors can again be understood in terms of the topo- logical relation between theh ex(T) curve and the phase- transition line. Double-reentrant superconductivity oc-curs whenh ex(0)< H pand four or five intersections ap- pear, while the complex regime arises forh ex(0)> H p with three or four intersections, resembling the reen- trant case. Since temperature-dependent magnetic tran- sitions can further modify the exchange field [19, 34–36], even richer temperature-dependent superconducting be- haviors may emerge from additional intersection points or shifts in the relative magnitude ofh ex(0)/H p, a possi- bility that lies beyond the scope of this Letter. According to the discussion above, the divergent tem- perature behaviors originate from the distinct forms of the exchange field relation. Notably, an effective ex- change field can also be introduced by applying an ex- ternal magnetic fieldh, thereby providing a means to tune ferromagnetic superconductivity. Supported by ex- perimental observations [13–15], the orbital contribution in many heavy-fermion ferromagnets is insignificant, so the external field primarily acts as an additional exchange field [37]. Since the intrinsic ferromagnetic exchange field has a fixed direction but a temperature-dependent mag- nitude, adjusting the orientation and strength of the ex- ternal field offers a direct route to modify the overall tem- perature dependence. The total exchange field is then given by ht(T) =q (hex(T) +hcosθ)2+h2sin2θ,(4) whereθis the angle between the applied fieldhand the intrinsic exchange fieldh ex(T). For fixed values ofh ex(0), Tm, ands, the resultingh-θphase diagram can be sys- tematically classified using the same string-compression method introduced above. To illustrate the tunability of temperature-dependent superconductivity under magnetic fields, we focused on the representative case ofs= 0.5. In this regime, all phases can in principle emerge for suitable choices of hex(0) andT m. To track their evolution, we selected rep- resentative parameter sets corresponding to each phase ath= 0 and mapped the associatedh-θphase diagrams. Given the",

To track their evolution, we selected rep- resentative parameter sets corresponding to each phase ath= 0 and mapped the associatedh-θphase diagrams. Given the large number of possible phases, we restricted the main discussion to the monotonic case, which is of particular experimental relevance, while the full analy- sis of other phases is provided in the SM. A summary of both theoretical and experimental results is presented in Table II. As shown, our framework not only repro- 4 duces previously observed field-induced transformations, but also predicts several additional, more exotic phase- switching processes. The monotonic behaviors can be further classified into three types [Fig. 1(a)]. Under an applied magnetic field, however, we find that the transformation behavior is de- termined almost solely by the number of intersection pointsM(see SM for details). Specifically,M= 0 andM= 1 correspond to the conditionsT m< T c0 (Tc0≈0.57∆ 0) andT m> T c0, respectively, indicat- ing thatT m=Tc0serves as the boundary between the two topological classes. Our analysis further reveals that states located near this boundary exhibit mixed features of both regimes, giving rise to a distinct form of transfor- mation. To capture these effects, we analyzed the mag- netic response for monotonic behaviors withM= 0, near theT m=Tc0boundary, and withM= 1, as summarized in the phase diagram of Fig. 3(a).

(b-d) ∆(T, h) maps for each case alongθ= 0◦ (b), 90◦(c), and 180◦(d). Distinct temperature-dependent behaviors at differenthare separated by dashed light-blue lines, with gap amplitude denoted by the color scale (lower right). The dashed line in (d) highlights field-induced en- hancement of superconductivity. Parameter sets: first col- umn,M= 1 case (h ex(0) = 0.35,T m= 1.40,s= 0.50); sec- ond column,M= 1 case near theM= 1/M= 0 boundary (hex(0) = 0.66,T m= 0.58,s= 0.50); third column,M= 0 case (h ex(0) = 0.40,T m= 0.40,s= 0.50). Theh-θphase diagrams highlight that the directionof the applied magnetic field often overlooked in ex- periments [20, 21], is crucial for tuning temperature- dependent behaviors. To illustrate this, we present ∆(T, h) maps at fixed field orientations [Figs. 3(b)-(d)]. For theM= 1 case, the system remains monotonic for all field strengths and directions, while the critical field in- creases significantly asθvaries from 0◦to 180◦. Near the Tm=T c0boundary, however, more complex responses emerge. Atθ= 0◦or 90◦, the behavior evolves sequen- tially from monotonic to reentrant, to double-reentrant, back to reentrant, and finally to monotonic as the field strength increases; the critical field is notably larger at θ= 90◦. Corresponding transitions between monotonic- reentrant-monotonic superconductivity atθ= 0◦or 90◦ have been observed in HoNi 2B2C [33], though the pre- dicted double-reentrant phase has not yet been detected, likely due",

Corresponding transitions between monotonic- reentrant-monotonic superconductivity atθ= 0◦or 90◦ have been observed in HoNi 2B2C [33], though the pre- dicted double-reentrant phase has not yet been detected, likely due to its narrow parameter range and experimen- tal field resolution. For theM= 0 case, monotonic su- perconductivity can evolve into a narrow reentrant region and then into non-monotonic behavior alongθ= 0◦or 90◦, consistent with monotonic-to-non-monotonic transi- tions reported in TmNi 2B2C [20]. In contrast, no trans- formation occurs alongθ= 180◦, where the system re- mains monotonic. Notably, in theM= 1 regime at θ= 180◦, we also find a slight enhancement ofT cin- duced by the magnetic field [Fig. 3(d)]. Since monotonic behavior withM= 1 can occur in two distinct forms, we analyzed the field-inducedT c0en- hancements for both cases in detail. To capture the re- sponse to field strength and orientation, the correspond- ingT c(h, θ) maps are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(d). For intersections at the second-order transition regime, only a slight enhancement ofT cis observed in the map- ping, whereas for intersections at the first-order regime, requiringT m> T c0andh ex≲H p, a dramaticT cin- crease up to nearly fivefold emerges. To further clarify the field dependence,T c(h) curves alongθ= 90◦→180◦ are presented in Figs.4(b) and 4(e). Both reveal that Tcenhancement occurs for 90◦< θ <270◦, consistent with the interpretation that the external magnetic field compensates the intrinsic exchange field. While mod- est field-inducedT cenhancements have been reported in lithium-intercalated FeSe and related systems [24–26], the tremendous enhancement predicted here remains to be experimentally realized. Finally, the angular sensi- tivity of the enhancement was analyzed by fixinghto maximizeT cin Figs.4(a) and 4(d) and mapping ∆(T, θ) [Figs. 4(c) and 4(f)]. Compared with the zero-field case, the enhancement is highly angle-dependent and, for cer- tain parameters (see SM), can be fragile at fixedh. In particular, monotonic behavior with strongT cenhance- ment exhibits a critical angle beyond whichT cdrops sharply from its elevated value. In summary, we have systematically analyzed the fi- nite temperature superconducting behavior of FSC and their response to magnetic fields, based on a model in- 5 (a) (b) (c)(d) (e) (f)h=0.65 h=0.35 FIG. 4.

    "= 0.68,T m= 1.40 ands= 0.50. corporating a temperature-dependent ferromagnetic ex- change field and an isotropic superconducting order pa- rameter. While the model can be generalized by in- cluding anisotropic pairing and explicit coupling between ferromagnetism and superconductivity, even in its min- imal form it successfully reproduces all experimentally observed temperature-related behaviors [8, 10, 12, 20– 23] and classifies them according to the topological re- lation between theh ex(T) curve and the superconduct- ing phase boundary. Distinct ∆(T) curves are predicted for each regime [Figs. 1(b)-(d)], motivating future tun- neling spectroscopy in systems such as HoNi 2B2C and ErNi 2B2C, where only one direct gap measurement has been reported to date [30]. By comparing theh ex(0)-T mphase diagrams, we ex- plain why reentrant behavior is rarely observed, while also identifying novel double-reentrant and complex regimes with limited parameter-space coverage. More importantly, we show that magnetic fields provide a pow- erful knob to transform between different temperature- dependent behaviors, consistent with existing experimen- tal observations and predicting new transitions [Table II].Finally, our framework accounts for the recently reported slight magnetic-field-induced enhancement ofT c, and fur- ther predicts that under specific conditionsT ccan be enhanced by up to a factor of five, a phenomenon po- tentially observable in UGe 2under high pressure or in UCoGe [5, 8]. These results unify diverse temperature-related phe- nomena and their magnetic-field responses in FSC, and provide clear guidance for future experimental explo- ration.

Thermodynamic Potential derivation and calculation details Considering an isotropic pairing interaction, the Hamiltonian in the main text can be rewritten as ˆH=X k,σξσ(k)c† σ(k)c σ(k)−X k,k′gc† ↑(k)c† ↓(−k)c ↓(−k′)c↑(k′), ξ σ(k) =ξ(k) +σh ex,(S1) wheregis the coupling strength. The superconducting order parameter is defined as ∆ =g⟨c ↓(−k′)c↑(k′)⟩, which can be chosen real. Applying the mean-field approximation, the Hamiltonian (S1) simplifies to ˆH=∆2 g+X k\u0010 c† ↑(k)c† ↓(−k)\u0011\u0012 ξ↑(k) ∆ ∆−ξ ↓(−k)\u0013 c† ↑(k) c† ↓(−k)! +X kξ↓(−k).(S2) This Hamiltonian can be diagonalized via the standard Bogoliubov transformation, yielding ˆH=∆2 g+X k(ξ(k)−E(k)) +X s=±,kEs(k)α† s(k)α s(k),(S3) whereE s(k) =E(k) +sh exwithE(k) =p ∆2+ξ2(k). Hereα sdenotes the Bogoliubov quasiparticles, which obey fermionic statistics. The thermodynamic potential Ω follows from the partition function, Ω =−1 βlnZ, and can be expressed as [3, 38] Ω =∆2 g+X k(ξ(k)−E(k))−1 βX s=±X kln\u0010 1 +e−βE s(k)\u0011 ,(S4) Assuming the system is in the weak-coupling regime with a constant density of statesNwithin the interaction window, the thermodynamic potential can be expressed in integral form as Ω =∆2 g+ 2NZEc 0dξ\" ξ−p ξ2+ ∆2−1 βX s=±ln\u0012 1 +e−β\u0010√ ξ2+∆2+sh ex\u0011\u0013# ,(S5) whereE cis the cutoff energy. The gap equation follows from the stationary condition∂Ω/∂∆ = 0 ∆ 1 gN−ZEc 0dξ1−P sf\u0010p ξ2+ ∆2+sh ex\u0011 p ξ2+ ∆2 = 0,(S6) wheref(E) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function. At zero temperature and in the absence of a magnetic field (T=h ex= 0), the integral in Eq. (S6) can be evaluated analytically as 1 gN=ZEc 0dξ1p ξ2+ ∆2 0= ln Ec ∆0+s\u0012Ec ∆0\u00132 + 1 ≈ln\u00122Ec ∆0\u0013 .(S7) Using Eq. (S7) to eliminate the cutoff energy and integrating the temperature-independent term in Eq. S5, the thermodynamic potential can be rewritten in the form given in the main text: Ω =N∆2\u0012 ln∆ ∆0−1 2\u0013 −2N βZ∞ 0dξln\u0010 1 + 2 cosh(βh ex)e−β√ ∆2+ξ2+e−2β√ ∆2+ξ2\u0011 .(S8) In Eq. (S8), the upper integration limit has been extended fromE cto infinity, which is justified by the convergence of the temperature-dependent term and the assumption thatE cis sufficiently large. To simplify the calculation, we introduce a reduced thermodynamic potentialf(x) and define the following dimensionless quantities: 8 f(x)≡Ω N∆2 0, x≡∆ ∆0, δ≡hex ∆0, t≡kBT ∆0, z≡ξ ∆0.(S9) With these definitions, the reduced thermodynamic potential takes the form f(x) =x2\u0012 lnx−1 2\u0013 −2tZ∞ 0dzln\u0010 1 + 2 cosh(δ/t)e−√ z2+x2/t+e−2√ z2+x2/t\u0011 .(S10) As shown in Eq. (S10), the reduced thermodynamic potential depends only on the reduced order parameterx∈[0,1], for a given exchange field and temperature. In equilibrium, the thermodynamic potential must attain its global minimum. Thus, the self-consistent value of the order parameter,x∗= ∆/∆ 0, is obtained by minimizingf(x). Typical behaviors off(x) ath ex= 0 are shown in Fig. S1. (a) (b) FIG. S1. Typical reduced free-energyf(x) ath ex= 0.

As shown in Fig.S1(a), the minimum pointx∗of eachf(x) curve corresponds to the equilibrium value of ∆ at that state. It is evident that ∆ decreases gradually with increasing temperature, as expected. By minimizingf(x) at each temperature, the standard BCS ∆(T) relation is recovered, shown as the blue line in Fig.S1(b). The calculation of ∆(h ex, t) can be carried out in the same manner, with the results presented in Fig. 1(a) of the main text. For convenience, the units ofh exandT mare expressed in terms of ∆ 0throughout the following discussion. 9 II. Topological-relation-dependent magnetic response As discussed in the main text, the magnetic response of a given temperature-dependent superconducting behavior can differ significantly depending on the underlying topological relation—specifically, the number of intersection points Mbetween the phase transition line and theh ex(T) curve. Focusing on the monotonic case, we analyze in greater detail how the magnetic response evolves under different parameter choices. (a) (b) (c) (d)(e) (a) (b)(c)(d)s=0.5 FIG. S2.h-θphase diagrams for the same intersection numberMbut with different parameters. (a,b) Phase diagrams for (a) M= 0 (h ex(0) = 0.40,T m= 0.40,s= 0.50) and (b)M= 1 with intersections in the second-order transition (SOT) regime (hex(0) = 0.35,T m= 1.40,s= 0.50), corresponding to Fig. 3(a) in the main text.

(e) Enlargedh ex(0)-T mphase diagram fors= 0.50, with the parameters for (a-d) marked by white symbols with black outlines. The dashed-dotted black line denotes theT m=Tc0boundary. Different behaviors are classified by the color scale (same convention used in subsequent figures). We systematically calculated theh-θphase diagrams for different monotonic behaviors. For theM= 0 andM= 1 cases far from theT m=T c0boundary, parameters distinct from those used in the main text were selected. The resulting phase diagrams are compared in Fig. S2.

Figure S3 shows theh-θphase diagrams for four representative points across this boundary. By fixingh ex(0) = 0.40, the values ofT mwere varied from 0.50 to 0.60, crossing the boundary atT m≈0.57. 10 As seen in Fig.S3(a) and S3(d), theT m= 0.50 case is topologically equivalent to theM= 0 regimes far from the boundary [Fig.S2(a,c)], while theT m= 0.60 case corresponds toM= 1 regimes far from the boundary [Fig.S2(b,d)]. For the intermediate casesT m= 0.53 andT m= 0.56 [Figs.S3(b,c)], mixed magnetic responses emerge. In summary, forM= 1 cases sufficiently far from theT m=Tc0boundary, monotonic superconductivity persists under any external magnetic field until it is fully suppressed. In contrast,M= 0 cases far from the boundary exhibit divergent responses, including monotonic→reentrant→non-monotonic sequences and related processes [Figs. S2(a,c)]. Near the boundary, mixed transformations such as monotonic→reentrant→monotonic behavior can occur. 11 III. Magnetic-field-induced transformations for all phases In the main text, we presented magnetic-field-induced transformations only for monotonic behaviors. Here, we extend the analysis to other phases, with the results summarized in Table 2 of the main text. A. Non-monotonic phases As discussed in the main text [Fig. 1(c)], non-monotonic behavior can be further categorized into three distinct types. For the case ofM= 2 with both intersections lying in the SOT regime, the phase cannot occur when s= 0.50. Therefore, to study all possible non-monotonic responses comprehensively, we sets= 1.0 and calculated the correspondingh-θphase diagrams. (a) (b) (c) (d)(e) (a) (b) (c) s=1.0 FIG. S4.h-θphase diagrams for different types of non-monotonic behavior. (a)M= 1 with intersections in the FOT regime (hex(0) = 0.90,T m= 0.10,s= 1.0). (b)M= 1 with intersections in the SOT regime (h ex(0) = 0.90,T m= 0.45,s= 1.0). (c) M= 2 with both intersections in the SOT regime (h ex(0) = 0.72,T m= 0.57,s= 1.0). (d)M= 1 with intersections in the FOT regime but close to the SOT boundary (h ex(0) = 0.90,T m= 0.35,s= 0.5), shown for comparison with (b). (e) Enlarged hex(0)-T mphase diagram fors= 1.0, with parameters used in (a-c) marked. As seen in Fig. S4, the magnetic response is primarily determined by the intersection numberM. ForM= 1, the transformations are topologically equivalent, as illustrated in Figs. S4(a,b), and the distinction between FOT and SOT intersections is largely insignificant. In this case, the only possible transformation is non-monotonic→ monotonic. ForM= 2, however, a narrow reentrant regime can appear, giving rise to more complex sequences such as non-monotonic→reentrant→monotonic, as shown in Fig. S4(c). Additionally, to verify the universality ofM-determined transformation behaviors, we also calculated the case of s= 0.50 withM= 1 in the FOT regime [Fig.S4(d)]. Its response is topologically equivalent to Figs.S4(a,b), further confirming this conclusion. B. Reentrant phases A similar analysis was carried out for reentrant behavior, which can also be categorized into three types according to theirh-θphase diagrams. Unlike the monotonic and non-monotonic cases, where magnetic responses are determined almost entirely by the intersection numberM, the field-induced transformations of reentrant behaviors depend sensitively on the full",
    "phases A similar analysis was carried out for reentrant behavior, which can also be categorized into three types according to theirh-θphase diagrams. Unlike the monotonic and non-monotonic cases, where magnetic responses are determined almost entirely by the intersection numberM, the field-induced transformations of reentrant behaviors depend sensitively on the full topo- logical relation between the phase transition lines and theh ex(T) curves, as illustrated in Figs.S5(a-d). Cases with the same topology, such as Figs.S5(a,b), are nearly equivalent, and the slight differences arise from the narrow parameter-space coverage of reentrant behavior, which makes them particularly sensitive to proximity to the topolog- ical boundary. The greater diversity of responses in reentrant phases stems from their more complex topological relations, involving additional intersection points. The detailed transformation sequences are indicated in Fig. S5 and are not elaborated here. 12 (a) (b) (c) (d)(e) (a) (b) (c) (d) s=0.5 FIG. S5.h-θphase diagrams for different types of reentrant behavior. (a)M= 2 with both intersections in the FOT regime (hex(0) = 0.70,T m= 0.54,s= 0.50). (b)M= 2 with both intersections in the FOT regime but closer to the boundary (hex(0) = 0.70,T m= 0.55,s= 0.50). (c)M= 2 with both intersections in the SOT regime (h ex(0) = 0.67,T m= 0.56, s= 0.50).

Double-reentrant and complex phases For double-reentrant and complex behaviors, classification by topological relations is less practical because of their very narrow existence in theh ex(0)-T mparameter space. Therefore, we present only representativeh-θphase diagrams, shown in Fig. S6. (a) (b) (c) (b) (a)s=0.5 FIG. S6.h-θphase diagrams for representative double-reentrant and complex behaviors. (a) Double-reentrant case with hex(0) = 0.69,T m= 0.56,s= 0.50. (b) Complex case withh ex(0) = 0.71,T m= 0.56,s= 0.50. (c) Enlargedh ex(0)-T mphase diagram fors= 0.50 near the double-reentrant and complex regimes, with parameters used in (a-b) marked. The magnetic responses of the double-reentrant and complex behaviors show strong similarities, closely resembling the field-induced transformations of the reentrant cases in Figs.S5(a-d). This similarity arises from their proximity in parameter space. In principle, double-reentrant and complex phases could be further subdivided, but the results in Fig.S6, together with the above discussion, indicate that such classification would be of little significance. Interestingly, by comparing Fig.S5 with Fig.S6(a), one finds that the double-reentrant phase lies at the center of three distinct reentrant regimes. Consequently, its magnetic response shares features with each reentrant type, even though the different reentrant phases themselves exhibit divergent transformations under external fields. D. Transformations of non-superconducting phases Most strikingly, non-superconducting states, where superconductivity is suppressed by a strong ferromagnetic ex- change field, can be transformed into various superconducting phases through compensation of the ferromagnetism. 13 Representative transformations under external magnetic fields are shown in Fig. S7.

As shown in Fig.S7(a-d), the magnetic responses of non-superconducting states can be classified into three types. The first type lies in the upper-left region of theh ex(0)-T mphase diagram, whereh ex(0)≫H pbutT m≈T c0 [Fig.S7(a)]. The second type appears in the lower-right region, whereh ex(0)≈H pbutT m≫T c0[Fig.S7(d)]. The third type occurs near the double-reentrant and complex regimes, whereh ex(0)≈H pandT m≈Tc0, effectively acting as an intermediate between the first two types [Figs.S7(b,c)]. For cases with both largeh ex(0) andT m, the response is less conclusive and may belong to one of these three categories. Because magnetic-field-induced superconductivity emerging from a non-superconducting state corresponds to the so-called high-field reentrant superconductivity (HFRS), it is of particular interest to analyze its magnetic response in more detail, given the relevance to recent HFRS experiments. By fixingθ= 180◦, the calculated ∆(T, h) relations for the non-superconducting cases discussed above are shown in Fig. S8. (a) (b) (d) (c) θ=180° Monotonic ReentrantNon-monotonicReentrantMonotonic MonotonicReentrantMonotonic FIG. S8. Magnetic-field-induced transformations of non-superconducting states atθ= 180◦. (a-d) ∆(T, h) maps corresponding to the cases in Fig. S7(a-d). Each distinct behavior is labeled (very narrow regimes are omitted). The yellow contour denotes the ∆ = 0 boundary, i.e., theh-Tphase transition line (same convention used in subsequent figures). The gap amplitude is indicated by the color scale. In Figs. S8(a-d), the yellow contour separates superconducting and non-superconducting regions and can be regarded as theh-Tphase transition line. Notably, in Fig. S8(a), the transition curve is asymmetric with respect toh ex(0), consistent with recent experiments on orphan UTe 2[32], but incompatible with the conventional WHH theory [40], which requires symmetry abouth ex(0). Additionally, as the parameters evolve from Fig.S7(a) to Fig.S7(d), theh-Tphase transition lines also shift cor- respondingly in Fig. S8(a-d). These lines gradually become symmetric abouth ex(0), which can be understood as a consequence ofh ex(T) remaining nearly constant withinT∈[0, T c0]. Thus, by appropriately tuning the parameters, the slight asymmetry in theh-Tphase diagram can be controlled, consistent with recent experimental observations 14 [40]. A more detailed analysis of theh-Tphase transition line in high-field reentrant superconductivity (HFRS) will be presented in a future work and lies beyond the scope of this article and Supplementary Material. In conclusion, we have shown that the magnetic response of monotonic and non-monotonic behaviors is primarily governed by the intersection numberM, whereas field-induced transformations of reentrant behaviors are controlled by the full topological relation between the phase transition lines and theh ex(T) curve. The detailed transformation processes are presented in Figs. S2-S6. In principle,h-Tphase diagrams can be computed for anyθ, but these are omitted here due to space limitations. We also note that",

The detailed transformation processes are presented in Figs. S2-S6. In principle,h-Tphase diagrams can be computed for anyθ, but these are omitted here due to space limitations. We also note that the physics near topological boundaries is especially intriguing and will be addressed in future work. Finally, we have discussed the transformation from non-superconducting to superconducting phases, which shows good agreement with recent experimental results on HFRS. 15 IV. Comparisons with experimental observations In the main text, we demonstrated that our calculations can account for nearly all reported experimental ob- servations. The three temperature-dependent superconducting behaviors are well established and have been widely observed inR-Tmeasurements [8, 10, 12, 20–23, 33]. These behaviors are naturally reproduced within our framework and further classified, as shown in Fig. 1 of the main text. Because these results are already extensively documented, we did not reproduce the specificR-Tcurves here, and readers are referred to the cited works for detailed data1. To provide more direct support for our theory, we next discuss several detailed experimental results in greater depth. A. Specific heat and tunneling measurements in EuRh 4B4 Our calculations indicate that the superconducting transition should be first order at low temperatures but second order at higher temperatures. This distinction can be directly probed through specific-heat experiments. In addition, the calculated ∆(T) relation provides more detailed information that can be compared with tunneling measurements, which remain relatively scarce. The relevant comparisons are summarized below. Particular attention is given to EuRh 4B4, the only system for which tunneling data are available [30]. In transport experiments2, a divergent low-temperature specific-heat anomaly was observed [22], consistent with a first-order transition, while a discontinuity in the high-temperature regime confirmed the presence of a second-order transition. Notably, LuRh 4B4shows only a high-temperature discontinuity, again supporting this interpretation [Fig. 1(a) in the main text]. Most strikingly, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap extracted from tunneling spectroscopy3exhibits remarkable agreement with our calculated results, as shown in Fig. S9. FIG. S9. Comparison between the calculated ∆(T) relation and tunneling measurements of EuRh 4B4. Experimental data were extracted from [30]. The dashed-dotted black line marks the critical point separating the FOT and SOT regimes. Parameter set:h ex(0) = 0.90,T m= 0.10,s= 0.50. Despite the excellent consistency, only limited tunneling measurements are currently available for comparison. We are therefore particularly enthusiastic about future experiments that could provide more detailed data for further validation. B. Magnetic response in HoNi 2B2C, TmNi 2B2C, and other FSCs The magnetic responses of the various phases were systematically analyzed in Section III. Theh-θphase diagrams from Figs. S2-S7 can account for all experimentally observed field-induced transformations. Here we highlight several representative monotonic cases. For ErNi 2B2C, the superconductivity remains monotonic under magnetic field until it is completely suppressed, consistent with theh-θphase diagram of Fig. S2(d). TmNi 2B2C exhibits a transformation from monotonic to non- monotonic behavior, which is well explained by Fig. S2(c); the absence of reentrant behavior can be attributed to its 1RepresentativeR-Tcurves",

In contrast, HoNi 2B2C shows monotonic→reentrant transformations under field, consistent with theh-θphase diagrams of Figs. S3(b,c), whereT m≈T c0. To further compare with experimentally obtained H-Tphase diagrams4, we have carried out quantitative calculations. A more detailed comparison, including orbital depairing and additional effects, will be presented in future work. (a) (b) (c) θ=0° θ=0° θ=0° FIG. S10. RepresentativeH-Tphase diagrams (θ= 0◦) for FSCs with monotonic temperature dependence. (a) ErNi 2B2C- type:h ex(0) = 0.20,T m= 0.20,s= 0.50. (b) TmNi 2B2C-type:h ex(0) = 0.40,T m= 0.58,s= 0.50. (c) HoNi 2B2C-type: hex(0) = 0.677,T m= 0.58,s= 0.50. The calculatedH-Tphase-transition lines show good agreement with experimental results in both shape and trend5. C. Explanation of divergent behaviors in the same material Experiments have shown that the same material may exhibit slightly different temperature-dependent behaviors. For example, HoNi 2B2C has been reported to display both monotonic and reentrant behavior6. These divergent results can be naturally explained within theh ex(0)-T mphase diagram. It has been established thatT m≈Tc0in HoNi 2B2C [26], placing the system near the phase boundary separating monotonic and reentrant regimes, as illustrated in Fig. S11(d).

To further demonstrate how slight parameter variations can drastically alter the temperature-dependent supercon- ducting behavior, we analyzed several cases near this boundary [Figs. S11(a-c)]. A monotonic state can be tuned into a reentrant state, and even into a double-reentrant state (though the latter is unlikely due to its extremely narrow stability region), with parameter changes as small as 1%. Such sensitivity likely explains the divergent behaviors reported in experiments. 4See experimental results for ErNi 2B2C and TmNi 2B2C in Fig. 3 of [20], and for HoNi 2B2C in Fig. 8 of [33]. 5See magnetic-field-dependentR-Tcurves for ErNi 2B2C andTmNi 2B2C in Fig. 2 of [20], and for HoNi 2B2C in Figs. 3 and 4 of [33]. 6See reentrantR-Tcurves in Fig. 1 of [20], and monotonicR-T curves in Fig. 2 of [33]. 17 V.

Fragile T cenhancement and orbital depairing effects In the main text, we showed thatT ccan be enhanced either slightly or significantly, depending on the circumstances. Experimentally, however, only slight enhancements have been reported. For example, in lithium-intercalated FeSe, the observedT cincrease was only about 0.5% and proved highly fragile with respect to field tilting [26]. This angular sensitivity can be understood in terms of orbital depairing. Because the sample thickness (14 nm) is much smaller than the coherence length, the in-plane field can be treated as providing only an effective exchange field, with orbital (vortex) depairing largely excluded [26]. By contrast, an out-of-plane field inevitably introduces orbital depairing, leading to additional suppression of superconductivity. As a result, the observedT cenhancement is fragile under tilted magnetic fields. Here, we first show that the magnitude of the slightT cenhancement can be tuned by selecting appropriate values of hex(0) andT m(withs= 0.50). As expected, the enhancement decreases with smallerh ex(0), since it originates from the compensation of the exchange field. Assuming orbital effects are negligible (as in the case of in-plane magnetic fields), we calculate the angular dependence ofT cenhancement for different parameter sets. (a) (b)(c) (d)(e) (f) FIG. S12. Magnetic-field-inducedT cenhancement for different parameters without orbital depairing. (a,c,e) Field dependence ofTcalongθ= 90◦,120◦,150◦,180◦for three cases: relatively large (a-b), moderate (c-d), and small (e-f) enhancements. Insets: zoomed views highlighting the slight enhancements. (b,d,f) ∆(T, θ) maps at fixedhvalues chosen to maximizeT c(h= 0.30, 0.20, 0.10 for b, d, f respectively). Blonde curves trace the field-enhancedT cas a function ofθ, while light-blue lines denote the zero-fieldT c(0). Parameters: (a-b)h ex(0) = 0.30,T m= 1.40,s= 0.50; (c-d)h ex(0) = 0.20,T m= 1.40,s= 0.50; (e-f) hex(0) = 0.10,T m= 1.40,s= 0.50. As shown in Fig.S12(a), (c), and (e),T cenhancement can be achieved for 90◦< θ <270◦when orbital effects are excluded. This behavior is readily understood as compensation of the total exchange field. Furthermore, when his fixed to maximizeT c(as in the main text), the enhancement is restricted to 120◦< θ <240◦[Fig.S12(b), (d), and (f)], again consistent with the compensation picture. These results are in full agreement with the main-body analysis. Importantly, as illustrated in Figs. S12(e,f), the enhancement can become extremely slight, rendering it highly vulnerable to perturbations. To further demonstrate the fragility ofT cenhancement, we next include orbital effects. Within the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework, free-energy densityf sof a superconductor can be expressed as fs=f0+α|ψ|2+β 2|ψ|4+1 2m∗|(−iℏ∇ −2eA)ψ|2,(S11) whereψis the superconducting order parameter (ψ∼∆), and the orbital depairing effect is described by the last term in Eq. (S11). The orbital depairing energy under a magnetic field can be obtained from the first GL equation, which in this case is mathematically equivalent to solving the Schr¨ odinger equation with a harmonic potential, a standard textbook result [39]. Consequently, the orbital energy spectrum is quantized into Landau levels En= 2\u0000 n+1 2\u0001 µBH⊥,(S12) whereµ Bis the Bohr magneton andH ⊥is the out-of-plane component of the external magnetic field.

    "odinger equation with a harmonic potential, a standard textbook result [39]. Consequently, the orbital energy spectrum is quantized into Landau levels En= 2\u0000 n+1 2\u0001 µBH⊥,(S12) whereµ Bis the Bohr magneton andH ⊥is the out-of-plane component of the external magnetic field. For the ground 18 state, the orbital energy reduces toE=µ BH⊥. Considering the averaged thermodynamic potential of the system and applying Eq. (S11), the reduced orbital contribution can be expressed as forb=αµBH⊥ ∆0\u0012∆ ∆0\u00132 ,(S13) whereαis a phenomenological coefficient chosen asα= 1 in our calculations. We note that this treatment is approximate, but it captures the essential depairing effect and illustrates the fragility of theT cenhancement. Eq. (S13) is incorporated into Eq. (S10) to account for orbital depairing, and the same minimization procedure is then applied to determine ∆. The angular dependence ofT cenhancement with orbital depairing included was subsequently calculated for different parameter sets. (a) (b)(c) (d)(e) (f) FIG. S13. Magnetic-field-inducedT cenhancement with orbital depairing included. (a,c,e) Field dependence ofT calong θ= 90◦,120◦,150◦,180◦for three cases: relatively large (a-b), moderate (c-d), and small (e-f) enhancements. (b,d,f) ∆(T, θ) maps at fixedhchosen to maximizeT c. Blonde curves trace the field-enhancedT cas a function ofθ, while light-blue lines denote the zero-fieldT c(0). Parameters are identical to those used in Fig. S12 for direct comparison. By comparing Figs. S12 and S13, it is clear that orbital effects are detrimental toT cenhancement. Forθ= 180◦(in- plane magnetic field), the curves remain unchanged, consistent with the assumption that orbital effects are negligible in sufficiently thin films for in-plane fields. At other angles, however,T cdecreases rapidly asθshifts away from 180◦ toward 90◦, highlighting the fragility of the enhancement once orbital depairing is included. Moreover, the results in Figs. S13(c) and S13(d) show qualitative agreement with experimental data7. The angular sensitivity is further highlighted by calculations with finer angular resolution of 2◦nearθ= 180◦, as shown in Fig. S14. It is found that theT cenhancement vanishes within 5◦of misalignment, confirming its fragility under orbital-depairing perturbations. FIG. S14. CalculatedT cwith fine angular resolution (θ= 174◦-180◦), illustrating the extreme sensitivity of the enhancement to field orientation. 7See Fig. 3(d), 3(e) and 3(f) of [26]."
