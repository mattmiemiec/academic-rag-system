(Dated: November 18, 2025) We identify and characterize a ﬁrst-order dark-state phase transit ion between a discrete dark soliton and a uniform superﬂuid in a Bose-Hubbard chain with a sin gle lossy site. Using classical- ﬁeld (truncated-Wigner) simulations together with a Bogoliu bov stability analysis, we show that the dark-state nature of the soliton suppresses ﬂuctuations an d shifts the critical point relative to the comparable phenomenon of optical bistability in driven-d issipative Kerr resonators. We then demonstrate that this mechanism quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the experiment of R. Labouvie et al.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 235302 (2016)], resolving substantial discrepancies in prior modeling eﬀorts. Our results reveal how dri ving, dissipation and quantum coherence can interact to induce nonequilibrium phase transiti ons in ultra-cold atomic gases. Introduction.— Whiledissipationisoftenseenasanui- sance for quantum systems, engineered dissipation can stabilize coherent many-body states and even drive new nonequilibrium phenomena [1–4]. Prominent experimen- tal examples include exciton-polariton condensation [5], a Mott insulator of photons [6], and the Mott-superﬂuid transition via engineered two-body loss in cold atoms [7]. This provides a new frontier to investigate the role of quantum ﬂuctuations in driven-dissipative phase transi- tions [8, 9], as illustrated by recent work showing that dark states [10, 11] can induce phenomena such as ab- sorbing state phase transitions [12–14] and nonequilib- rium quantum critical dynamics [15–17]. A canonical, ﬁrst-order phase transition is given by the so-called ‘opti- cal bistability’ in driven-dissipative Kerr resonators [18], where switches between macrostates can be induced by quantum ﬂuctuations [19]. Analogous transitions have been studied in a wide range of systems [20–24]. In this work we demonstrate a ﬁrst-order dark-state phase transition between a dark soliton and a uniform superﬂuid in a dissipative Bose-Hubbard (BH) model [Fig. 1(a)]. A dark soliton is an excited eigenmode of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation characterized by a π phase slip and vanishing density at its core, which al- lows the state to decouple from locally engineered loss. The transition resembles optical bistability, yet the soli- ton’s spatial phase texture and dark-state character sup- pressﬂuctuationsandshiftthecriticalpoint. Usingsemi- classical ﬁeld models, we further show that this phase transition quantitatively explains recent cold-atom ex- periments [24–26] that so far have eluded understanding from ﬁrst principles. Beyond the implications for exper- iments, our work identiﬁes a unique nonequilibrium crit- ical phenomenon driven by the interplay of quantum co- herence and dissipation.

The complex Gaussian noise ηsatisﬁes ⟨η(t)⟩= 0 and ⟨η(t)η∗(t′)⟩=δ(t−t′). Under the in- ﬂuence of driving from a large number of highly occu- pied sites on either side, the lossy site swiftly relaxes to a (quasi-)steady state determined by the balance between the loss rate and tunneling amplitude. For weak tunnel- ing,J/γ≪1, losses dominate and the central site settles in a “normal” (quantum Zeno) state with low occupation and condensate fraction. In contrast, at large J/γa su- perﬂuid state emerges with the lossy site fully occupied. In the thermodynamic limit Nj∝N→ ∞, whereNj is the atom number for each site, there is a ﬁrst-order transition between these ‘empty’ and ‘full’ states at a critical value ( J/γ)c, for a ﬁxed γ/µ[51]. Consequently, the system displays bistability as shown in Fig. 1(b) by the associated hysteresis loop in the steady-state occu- pation. Similar results for a comparable system of cou- pled superﬂuid Josephson junctions have been demon- strated experimentally in Refs. [24–26]. Most previous analyses interpreted the low-density branch as a Kerr- like low-amplitude state [orange curve in Fig. 1(b)] with a single pump [24–26, 32, 51]. Reference [37] allowed for two pumps that could dephase, but did not consider their phase coherence and was not able to reproduce the experimental boundaries without changing experimental parameters. Here, we provide strong evidence that the local ‘empty’ state actually corresponds to a spatially ex- tended dark soliton.

It exhibits a πphase jump and vanishing density at the central site [Fig. 1(a)]. Together with the fact it is an eigenmode of the discrete 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, this ensures that the state completely decouples from the bath, makingthedarksolitonadarkstateofEqs.(1)and (2) in the mean-ﬁeld limit. The dark state exists for all parameter values, but its dynamic stability changes with Jandγ. This sta- bility determines the mean-ﬁeld hysteresis illustrated in Fig. 1(b), which compares the soliton bistability to con- ventional optical bistability. The hatched area indicates the diﬀerence in the area swept by the hysteresis loops.Im(ωl)Re(ωl) (a) 0.51.0 J/γ0.010.11λ/γ (b) 0.20.40.6 J/γ(c) FIG. 2.

Results with the soliton (green dots) are compared to those obtained with imposed mirror-symmetry (orange diamonds), which excludes the possibility of a soli- ton. Broken lines are ﬁts to guide the eye. Simulations were performed with a ﬁxed particle number per site and Llarge enough to avoid boundary eﬀects. The lower branch of the soliton bistability features a sud- den jump from zero (dark soliton) to a ﬁnite popula- tion at a threshold value J=Jt(for a ﬁxed γ/µ), in keeping with a ﬁrst-order phase transition. The semi- classical transition, where quantum ﬂuctuations are ig- nored, therefore corresponds to a ﬁrst-order dark-state phase transition , driven by a change in the stability of a dark state, as discussed in Refs. [9, 12–14]. To probe the stability of the dark soliton we analyze the Bogoliubov spectrum in the N→ ∞limit where the noise (dissipative and vacuum) vanishes. See Supplemen- tal Material (SM) [53] for derivations. Figure 2(a) shows the complex eigenvalues of the Bogoliubov modes for the two regimes. For J <Jt(green), all eigenvalues ωlhave Re(ωl)<0, implying damped excitations and making the soliton (3) a stable ﬁxed point. For J > J t(or- ange), a pair of complex eigenvalues cross the real axis, indicating the onset of dynamical instability of the dark state. This signiﬁes a Hopf bifurcation , in contrast to the saddle-node bifurcations observed for optical bistability [23]. The absence of a stable limit cycle indicates that the bifurcation is subcritical, leading the system to settle in the stable superﬂuid state. Notably, the eigenvalues of these unstable modes have a non-zero real part, which implies an oscillatory instability, as is typical of on-site solitons in 1D discrete lattices [52, 54]. Corrections to the perfect dark state from quantum ﬂuctuationsvanishwith O(1/N)(seeSM[53]fordetails), leading to signatures of the dark state for large but ﬁnite systems.

We will demonstrate its signiﬁcance for experi- mentallyrelevantsystemswithhundredsofsites. Tocap- ture the role of vacuum and dissipative noise in systems with ﬁnite atom numbers, we perform truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) simulations based on Eqs. (1) and (2). The inclusions of noise tends to smooth out the 3 mean-ﬁeld transition [19, 21], but the extended hystere- sis area remains. Individual Wigner trajectories exhibit jumps between the dark soliton and the uniform super- ﬂuid, in analogy with optical bistability, triggered by the dynamic noise. By extracting the characteristic switch- ing timeτfrom large ensembles of trajectories, we esti- mate the Liouvillian gap λ= 1/τ[51]. Similar switching behavior was inferred experimentally for a comparable system in Ref. [25]. Figures 2(b) and (c) display the Liouvillian gap λas a function of the tunneling parameter Jat ﬁxed dissi- pation rates (green). Results are also displayed with en- forced mirror symmetry around the central site (orange) to prohibit soliton formation. The minimum gap, the best estimate for the critical point J=Jc, is seen to be lower for the soliton-superﬂuid transition, indicating fewer ﬂuctuations. The correspondingly slower switching rate is due to the fact that in order to switch from a soli- ton to the superﬂuid, the phase of the entire reservoir on the left or right must be ﬂipped by π. In comparison, for optical bistability, switches in separate trajectories are driven by dynamic noise or ﬂuctuations in the driving of a single site. The soliton bistability therefore requires increased ﬂuctuations, as occurs at larger values of J. This diﬀerence between the simulations with and with- out a soliton increases as the loss rate γgrows, as shown by the minima in Fig. 2(c), due to the increased stabil- ity of the soliton. The curve also broadens signiﬁcantly, reﬂecting a wider region around the minimum that is aﬀected by critical slowing down. This is in contrast to optical bistability, which sees a closing of this region with increasing γ[37, 55]. Looking ahead, this is also shown in the bistability phase diagram, Fig. 4(a)-(b), which demonstrates broadening of the bistable region in theγ−Jplane at larger loss rates only for the soliton bistability [Fig. 4(a)]. Application to experiment.— We now demonstrate that the soliton dark-state phase transition quantita- tively explains recent experimental observations in su- perﬂuid arrays with a single lossy site [24–26, 45]. These experiments were performed with ultracold rubidium in a quasi-1D Josephson chain, where each site still has sub- stantial radial extent determined by a 2D isotropic har- monic trap in the x-yplane with frequency ωr[Fig. 1(a)]. The discrete lattice is oriented in the z-direction, and the central site is subject to an electron beam [56, 57] that introduces a controllable atom loss rate γ[27]. These experiments typically operate with O(103) par- ticles per site, such that we are able to approximate the dynamics using classical ﬁelds ψj(x,t)",

For a single experimental run, the system is initialized in its ground state, before atoms are removed from the central site (if required) using an electron beam. During this initial statepreparationthetwohalvesofthesystemarediscon- nected and can drift out of phase. We approximate this eﬀect by multiplying one half-chain by a random phase eiϕ[53], a method used in Ref. [49] to obtain quantitative agreement with a comparable experiment [45] focused on the dissipationless ( γ= 0) case. We ﬁrst demonstrate the emergence of the soliton for the experimental system. It has been argued that in the TWA formalism an individual trajectory is analogous to an individual experimental run [60]. Figure 3(a) shows the evolution of the phase at each site Φ jfor an example single Wigner trajectory with strong dissipation and an initial state with all sites full and the phase diﬀerence between driving sites |∆Φ0|=|Φ1−Φ−1| ≪π[62]. It can be seen that the system quickly relaxes to the soliton state with a πphase diﬀerence from left to right. Next, we demonstrate that despite the system’s signif- icant radial size, it is the 1D oscillatory instability of the 4 dark soliton that sets the relevant timescale. Figure 3(b) shows the evolution of phase Φ jfor a single trajectory starting from a dark soliton state but with no dissipation (γ= 0).

The corresponding evolution of the phase diﬀer- ence|∆Φ0|and the atom number on the lossy site, N0, are displayed in Fig. 3(c). The phase diﬀerence remains nearπuntil the time trat which the occupation has grown signiﬁcantly (dotted line). Around tr, the location of theπphase jump becomes unstable and propagates ballistically in a spontaneously chosen direction, seeded by quantum noise, leading to phase resynchronization. The robustness of a soliton-like excitation up to time tr is consistent with the slow change in atom number com- pared to cases with smaller phase diﬀerences, as shown by Ref. [49]. The change in occupation over time is ∂tNj= 2J/ℏ(Ij+1,j+Ij−1,j), (5) whereIk,j≡Im[⟨ψk|ψj⟩] denotes the current ﬂowing be- tween sites jandk. Figure 3(d) shows the time evolution of the current contributions from the respective driving sites,I−1,0andI1,0. While the total current remains small for some time, indicated by the slowly changing atom number in Fig. 3(c), the contributions from the left and right driving sites oscillate with approximately equal magnitude but opposite sign, characteristic of an oscillatory instability. This suggests that, despite each site being quasi-2D, it is the 1D physics that sets the dominant time-scale. The growth of these instabilities leads to ﬁlling of the site and consequent propagation of the phase slip in space (Fig. 3(b)). This remains the case when dissipation is added, which further extends the soliton lifetime (see SM [53]). Phase diagram.— We now construct the full bistabil- ity phase diagram by numerically solving Eqs. (1), (2), and (4) for a system of 251 lattice sites using the TWA. The dynamics are evaluated at a ﬁxed time t= 80 ms, starting from two distinct initial conditions: one with an initially empty central site and another with a full cen- tral site. Figure 4(a) shows the resulting atom number diﬀerence |∆N|between these two initial conditions, as a function of the tunneling Jand dissipation γ. A large |∆N|indicates sensitivity to initial conditions and thus signals bistability. For comparison, we overlay the exper- imentalphaseboundariesfromRef.[24]. Oursimulations show excellent agreement with the experimental data at the upper boundary (large J), where the system transi- tions from a dark soliton to a uniform superﬂuid. No- tably, this transition has not been accurately reproduced in previous theoretical studies except by unrealistically adjusting experimental parameters [37, 63]. To highlight the role of the soliton, Fig. 4(b) displays the results of simulations with imposed mirror symme- try. Enforcing perfect in-phase driving from both sides leads to a conventional optical bistability [24, 37, 51], which predominantly aﬀects the upper boundary of the bistable region.

While a lowering of the up- per boundary can possibly be attributed to thermal and quantum ﬂuctuations, it is much harder to account for anincrease of the upper phase boundary. We therefore conclude that the spatial phase structure of the soliton played a crucial role in the observed bistability. It would be interesting to conﬁrm this prediction by directly mea- suring this phase diﬀerence in experiment. Both phase diagrams diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the ex- perimental data at the lower boundary. While theo- retically this boundary is predicted to follow J=γ/4 [37, 55] (white dashed lines), a much steeper linear re- lation,J=γ, was found experimentally. We believe that this discrepancy can be explained by ﬁnite-size and temperature eﬀects. In particular, the experimental sys- tem in Ref. [24] only extended across ∼65 full sites, albeit not uniformly occupied due to the weak harmonic conﬁnement in the lattice direction. The sound velocity v=/radicalbig 2Jd2zµimplies that over these time-scales approx- imately 200 sites are needed to avoid ﬁnite-size eﬀects. The dissipation could therefore have time to reduce the atom number of all sites substantially, lowering the inter- actionenergyandmakingiteasiertoswitchtothesoliton state. Moreover, since an initial soliton state prevents substantial atom loss, the data at the upper boundary is far less aﬀected by ﬁnite-size eﬀects. In the SM [53] we conﬁrm this by showing that the slope of the lower 5 boundary increases with increasing ﬂuctuations in the initialstate, withoutsubstantiallyalteringtheagreement at the upper boundary. Conclusion.— Wehaveuncoveredasemi-classicalﬁrst- order dark-state phase transition between a dark soliton and uniform superﬂuid state, which we used to quantita- tively explain a phase boundary in a recent cold atoms experiment [24]. This result sheds new light on these and other experimental observations [25, 26], previously not understood from ﬁrst principles. We demonstrated this through comparison with the mirror symmetric system that displays a conventional optical bistability but is in stark disagreement with the experimental results. The transition can be understood via Bogoliubov theory and with the 1D Bose-Hubbard model, for which our results conﬁrm that the region of critical slowing down is sub- stantially broadened for the soliton bistability (as is seen in the phase diagram) and the critical point is shifted to higher tunnel couplings. Our results demonstrate that spatially extended co- herent phase structures can fundamentally alter mean- ﬁeld driven-dissipative transitions.

Looking ahead, this mechanism suggests potential vortex–superﬂuid transi- tions in 2D, stabilization of phase structures via spatially patterned dissipation, and using dissipation as a phase switch for soliton imprinting [4, 64–66] or for control- ling superﬂuid ﬂow [36]. Additionally, there are poten- tial links to two-terminal superﬂuid and superconducting junctions, where transport properties are substantially modiﬁed by single particle loss [44].

[58] In Fig. 3(a) we subtract the mean phase at each time, evaluated using the circular mean, for ease of visibility; this removes the rapidly oscillating global phase. How- ever, for an initial soliton conﬁguration as in Fig. 3(b), the circular mean vanishes because the two domains dif- fer by approximately π. In this case, we instead subtract by the average phase of the end sites, (Φ −L/2+ΦL/2)/2, which centers the soliton’s phase in each domain on ±π/2 respectively. We then correct for trivial global πshifts that can ﬂip these phases, i.e. ±π/2→ ∓π/2, from one time-step to the next. [59] P. B. Blakie and M. J. Davis, Physical Review A 72, 063608 (2005). [60] P.

(Dated: November 18, 2025) TRUNCATED WIGNER APPROXIMATION AND SEMI-CLASSICAL EQUATIONS OF MOTION We brieﬂy discuss the derivation of Eqs. 1 and 2 in the main text via the Wigner phase space formalism. We consider the dissipative Bose-Hubbard model described by the Lindblad master equation dˆρ(t) dt=−i[ˆH,ˆρ(t)]+ˆΓˆρ(t)ˆΓ†−1 2{ˆΓ†ˆΓ,ˆρ(t)},(S1) with Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian ˆH=−J/summationdisplay j/parenleftbig ˆa† j+1ˆaj+H.c./parenrightbig +U 2/summationdisplay jˆa† jˆa† jˆajˆaj,(S2) where ˆa† jand ˆajrespectively denote bosonic creation and annihilation operators for site j∈ {−L/2,L/2}in a 1D chain of length L+1, and the particle loss on the central site is described by the jump operator ˆΓ =√γˆa0.The parameterJis the nearest-neighbor tunneling amplitude andUis the on-site interaction energy. Equation S1 can berepresentedin2( L+1)dimensionalphasespace, where the Wigner function W[Ψ,Ψ∗] is the analogue of the den- sity matrix. The Wigner distribution evolves according to ∂W ∂t=−i/summationdisplay j/parenleftbigg∂ ∂ψjF[ψj]−c.c./parenrightbigg W[Ψ,Ψ∗] +γ 2∂2 ∂ψ0∂ψ∗ 0W[Ψ,Ψ∗]+O(∂3),(S3) where F[ψj] =J(ψj−1+ψj+1)−U(|ψj|2−1)ψj+iγδ0j 2ψj.(S4) Neglecting third order derivative terms, which vanish withO(1/N), this reduces to a Fokker–Planck equation, which can be mapped to the Langevin Eqs. 1 and 2 of the main text. This also implies an equation for the evo- lution of the local density nj, which in the limit N→ ∞ on every site is given by id dtnj=−J(ψj−1+ψj+1)ψ∗ j+H.c.−iδ0,jγjnj,(S5)whereψj=√njeiϕj.

    "dissipative contribution van- ishes for a dark soliton (Eq. 3 of the main text), since n0= 0. The conjugate equation for ϕ0is irrelevant as this phase is purely a gauge due to the vanishing den- sity. In addition, the dark soliton is an eigenmode of the remaining terms, i.e. the discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation iℏ∂tψj=−J(ψj−1+ψj+1)+U|ψj|2ψj.(S6) The vanishing dissipation and eigenmode condition make thedarksolitonadarkstateoftheLindbladmasterequa- tion in this limit. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS One dimension To determine the dynamical stability of the dark soli- ton in the dissipative Bose-Hubbard model we analyze the eigenvalues of Bogoliubov excitations on top of the stationary dark soliton. The relevant equations are ob- tained by substituting the ansatz ψj=ϕj+δψj(t) in Eq. 1 and 2 of the main text and expanding the small perturbation as δψj(t) =/summationdisplay lu(l) je−iωlt+v(l)∗ jeiω∗ lt.(S7) Here,u(l) jandv(l) jare the amplitudes of the l-th normal mode with associated mode frequency ωl. The resulting eigenvalue problem, ωluj,l=/parenleftbig −2J+2U|ψj|2−µ−iγ/2/parenrightbig uj,l +ψ2 jvj,l−J/parenleftbig uj−1,l+uj+1,l/parenrightbig , ωlvj,l=/parenleftbig 2J−2U|ψj|2+µ−iγ/2/parenrightbig vj,l −ψ2 juj,l+J/parenleftbig vj−1,l+vj+1,l/parenrightbig ,(S8) is solved numerically, with ϕjgiven by Eq. 3 in the main text. Two examples of the eigenvalue spectrum are de- pictedforvaluesof J/γaboveandbelowthecriticalpoint in Fig. 2 of the main text. These clearly indicate the dy- namically (un)stable nature ofthe dark statethrough the positive imaginary part of the individual modes. S2 100101 γ/J10−410−2100max(Im[ωl])/UJ/µ= 0.14 J/µ= 0.34 FIG. S1. Imaginary value of the pair of unstable modes as a function of relative dissipation strength γ/J(log-log scale). Diﬀerent line styles indicate diﬀerent system sizes; respec- tivelyL= 100 (solid), L= 200 (dash-dot) and L= 400 (dashed)forthefull, dash-dottedanddashedline. Thedotte d line illustrates the thermodynamic limit that was eﬀectively realised with the incoherently pumped model introduced in Ref. [S1]. Changesintheinstabilitygrowthrate,max[Im( ωl)],as a function of dissipation rate γare illustrated in Fig. S1. The solid lines represent the predictions of the incoherent pumpingmodelintroducedinRef.[S1]andshowtheswift decreasewithanincreasingdissipationrate. Theyclearly indicate, for a given tunneling strength J, a critical dissi- pation rate above which the dark soliton is rendered dy- namically stable. These curves are complemented with results for ﬁnite Bose-Hubbard arrays (obtained via Eq. S8) with hard-wall boundaries of diﬀerent lengths L, de- noted by the broken lines. For very small ℏγ/µ, the dif- ferent curves overlap, but eventually branch oﬀ. With increasingLthe growth rate curves also overlap with the solid lines up until larger values of γ/µ, indicating that the incoherent pumping model presented in [S1] provides a plausible extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, for a ﬁxed dissipation rate in the interme- diate regime of Fig. S1, the soliton lifetime, given by the inverse of the instability growth rate, increases with growing system size L. Intuitively, for the ﬁnite-size sys- tems, excitations created by the defect at the center of the chain can not leave the system and are able to de- stroy the soliton state after multiple reﬂections from the hard-wall boundaries. This eﬀect is reduced for larger chains. Notably, for large enough γ/µthe instability is still suppressed for the ﬁnite size systems.

The state is initialized with ∆Φ 0(0)≈πwith each half of the system in its ground-state and an initial occupation on the central site of approximately 5%. leads to the erasure of the soliton, just as in the 1D case discussed above. These simulations were carried out in the absence of dissipation. We now show that dissipation increases the stability of the soliton. We deﬁne the corre- sponding relaxation time tras the ﬁrst time in which the density on the central site exceed two-thirds of the value of a full site Nf, which indicates a signiﬁcant departure from the soliton state in its evolution towards a ‘full’ cen- tral site. This aligns with the deﬁnition of ‘ﬁlling time’ in recent work by some of us [S2] on unitary dynamics in a similar set-up. Figure S2 shows tras a function of γ. It can be seen that the relaxation time diverges exponen- tially with γasωr∆tr=ωr[tr−tr(γ= 0)]∼106.28γ/J, indicating that for ﬁxed Jthe soliton becomes increas- ingly stable at higher dissipation rates due to the sup- pression of the oscillatory instability. OPTICAL BISTABILITY In the main text, we mention that the mirror- symmetric system possesses a conventional optical bista- bility. This follows from observations of Ref. [S3], which developed a mean-ﬁeld theory for the central site driven by a single undepletable coherent reservoir ψRand sub- ject to dissipation. This is analogous to the situation in optical bistability of driven-dissipative Kerr resonators [S4]. The equations of motion for the ﬁeld ψ0are iℏdψ0 dt=µψ0+U|ψ0|2ψ0−2JψR−iγ 2ψ0,(S9) whereµis the chemical potential on the central site. The steady-state solution possesses regions with one or three solutions; the latter being the bistable region. A pitch- S3 fork bifurcation occurs at the transition from one to mul- tiple solutions. See Ref. [S3] for additional details. DETAILS OF EXPERIMENT AND SIMULATIONS Experiment As discussed in the main text, the experiment of Ref. [S5] involved a one-dimensional chain of two-dimensional harmonic traps. Following an initial cooling process that produces the cigar-shaped bulk condensate, a one- dimensional optical lattice is applied with a depth of s= 30Er(whereEris the lattice recoil energy), ef- fectively isolating every site in a deep well for approxi- mately 9 ms. During this preparation stage, the density on the central site can be independently adjusted relative to the rest of the system. To demonstrate bistability, two diﬀerent initial states are distinguished. The local dissi- pation mechanism is either",
    "fectively isolating every site in a deep well for approxi- mately 9 ms. During this preparation stage, the density on the central site can be independently adjusted relative to the rest of the system. To demonstrate bistability, two diﬀerent initial states are distinguished. The local dissi- pation mechanism is either activated or left oﬀ during the preparation stage, leading to two possible scenarios: the trap at the center of the chain is either almost com- pletely depleted or retains an occupation similar to the surrounding sites. Subsequently, the lattice is ramped down to a value within the range s= 6−12Er, initi- ating the system dynamics. At this lower lattice depth the electron beam is turned on to provide a continuous source of particle loss. The lattice spacing in the z-direction is a= 549 nm and the radial trap-frequency is ωr= 165×2πrad/s. The total number of Rb-87 atoms is 45 ×103, with massm= 1.44×10−25kg and an s-wave scattering lengthas= 5.8 nm. Traps near the center of the chain contain approximately N= 700 atoms. The setup is harmonically trapped in the z-direction as well, with ωz≈10×2πrad/s≪ωr. Simulation parameters and procedure For our simulations we neglect the slowly varying har- monic trap along the z-axis and simulate a uniform lat- tice, as in our recent work in Ref. [S2]. We begin with a ﬁrst principles calculation of the corresponding lat- tice potential in the z-direction, V(z) =V0sin2(kz), wherek= 2π/λis the lattice wavevector with wave- lengthλ= 2aand spacing a. In the lowest band ap- proximation the on-site potential can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator, V(z)≈ℏ2ω2 latz2/4Er, where Er=ℏ2k2/2mis the lattice recoil energy. Using the tight-binding approximation, the tunneling can be ob- tained asJ= ∆E/4 where ∆Eis the bandwidth of the lowest Bloch band [S6] which we obtain by diagonalizing ˆH=−ℏ2∂2 z/2m+V0(2πz/λ)2numerically. The tunnel couplingJandωlatare in one-to-one correspondence andwe restrict our attention to the experimentally relevant ranges [S5]. For a given ωlatthe interaction strength and chemi- cal potential can be computed as follows. Firstly, the 3D interaction strength is given by g= 4πℏ2as/m. Due to the tight conﬁnement in the z-direction, we model this direction as discrete. The eﬀective 2D interaction strength for each trap is given by numerically integrat- ing over the Wannier function w(z) in thez-direction, i.e.g2=g/integraltext dz w(z)4.The chemical potential is then estimated as µ=/radicalbig g2mω2rN/πusing the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Thisprocedureuniquelydetermines ωlat, g2, andµ. To ﬁnd the ground state we evolve the full chain in imaginary time. For the case in which the central site is initially full, this is taken as the initial condition. In contrast, for the complementary initial state we decrease the atom number on the central site to 5% of its full value. As discussed in our recent work [S2], the experi- mental preparation of the initially empty site introduces additional dephasing into the system. Speciﬁcally, both halves of the system are isolated from each other while the atom number is reduced on the central site. Ref. [S2] demonstrated numerically that the preparation stage is suﬃciently long to allow signiﬁcant diﬀusion of the rela- tive phases. Moreover, once the lattice",

[S2] demonstrated numerically that the preparation stage is suﬃciently long to allow signiﬁcant diﬀusion of the rela- tive phases. Moreover, once the lattice depth is lowered again, the empty site ensures that they cannot imme- diately ‘reconnect’, thereby allowing additional time for diﬀusion. To capture this eﬀect, for each Wigner tra- jectory we multiply the right-hand subset of the chain, R={j|j >0}, by random phase eiθwithθ∈[0,2π]. This phase randomization was shown by Ref. [S2] to be necessary to achieve quantitative agreement with the experimental results of a comparable setup, albeit one governed by unitary dynamics. For the dissipative sys- tem the eﬀect of this random phase is less signiﬁcant. For the case of an initially full-site conﬁguration, the choice of initial phase diﬀerence θhas no eﬀect on the long-time results. Simulation details In this section we provide a brief summary of the clas- sical ﬁeld (c-ﬁeld) numerical methods employed in the main text. For the complete three-dimensional conﬁgu- ration, where each trap is modeled as a two-dimensional system, we need to restrict the number of modes per trap to satisfy the c-ﬁeld approximation. This truncation is performed via the projection of the classical ﬁelds onto the coherent region C, deﬁned by P{f(x)}=/summationdisplay n∈Cφn(x)/integraldisplay d2x′φ∗ n(x′)f(x′).(S10) Here,φnare eigenmodes of the cartesian Hermite- Gauss computational basis with quantum numbers n∈ S4 {nx,ny}, which diagonalize the non-interacting problem (g2= 0). Letting n=nx+ny, we choose a cut-oﬀ ncut to deﬁne the “classical ﬁeld region” C={n|nx+ny≤ ncut}. This approach incorporates a consistent energy cut-oﬀ that limits the number of radial modes for each trap. In practice, we use a cut-oﬀ of approximately ncut= 2.5µ/ℏωr. Previous works [S2, S3] have shown that results for this system are largely independent of the exact cutoﬀ for ncut>2µ/ℏωr. This cut-oﬀ captures scattering processes in which two atoms at the chemi- cal potential energy collide, leading to one atom with energy 2µand another with approximately zero energy. This is anticipated to be relevant when the lossy site is signiﬁcantly depleted, with an energy that is lower than neighboring sites by approximately µ. Atoms therefore cannot tunnel directly into the depleted condensate, but can undergo tunneling into excited states of the trap and relax via collisions. Having deﬁned a classical ﬁeld region, the coupled pro- jected Gross-Pitaevskii equations, displayed in Eqs. (1) and (2) in combination with Eq. (4) of the main text, are integrated in the Hermite-Gauss basis using Gaus- sian quadrature [S7, S8].

FINITE-SIZE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS In this section we demonstrate that the discrepancy with experimental results at the lower boundary of the phasediagram, showninFig. 4(a)ofthemaintext, could potentially be accounted for by additional ﬂuctuations speciﬁc to the experimental setup. To mimic the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations due to a ﬁnite temperature, we increased the variance on the distribution for the initial conditions in Eq. (S11). Formally, this does not correspond to a ﬁnite temperature, but still provides a qualitative picture of how the phase boundaries would change. Fig. S3 shows the bistability phase diagrams for the cases where the standard deviation of the initial distri- bution is multiplied by (a) 1 .5 and (b) 2.

Phase diagram in J-γparameter space for L= 70, with increased uncertainty on initial state sampling as com- pared to the simulations in the main text: the standard devia- tionoftheinitialnoisedistributionismultipliedby(a)1 .5and (b) 2. The color indicates the late time (normalized) atomic population diﬀerence ∆ N(legend) between simulations start- ing from diﬀerent initial states: the empty and full central site respectively. Displayed data corresponds to t= 80 ms, aver- aged over 64 trajectories for each point. For comparison, the experimental phase boundaries from Ref. [S5] are displayed with points and are ﬁtted by J∼√γ(upper boundary) and J∼γ(lower boundary). The white dot-dash line indicates J=γ/4 as expected from theory. a smaller system with only 70 sites is simulated, in line with the experiment [S5]. Notably, the largest change can be observed in the slope of the lower boundary. En- hanced ﬂuctuations raise the lower boundary, but have no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the upper boundary, in agree- ment with observations in Ref. [S3]. We conclude that the smaller system size in combination with ﬂuctuations speciﬁc to the experimental setup cause the slope of the lower boundary to increase from the theoretical predic- tion ofJ=γ/4 [S3, S4] (white dashed-dotted line) to approximate the observed J=γ(blue dashed line). The upper boundary is less aﬀected due to the robust nature of the dark soliton. In addition, as discussed in the main text, the lower- boundary is expected to be far more sensitive to ﬁnite- size eﬀects at a given time, since an initial soliton state prevents substantial atom loss as compared to the ini- tially uniform superﬂuid state.
