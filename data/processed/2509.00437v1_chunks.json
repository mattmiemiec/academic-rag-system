This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework designed to process Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files . Our framework adopts a modified, pre-built rule-based component, updated with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)’s best practices guidelines, as outlined in DICOM PS 3.15, for improved performance. It incorporates PaddleOCR, a robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for extracting text from images, and RoBERTa, a fine-tuned transformer-based model for identifying and removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). Initially, the transformer-based model and the rule-based component were integrated to process for both structured data and free text. However, this coarse-grained approach did not yield optimal results. To improve performance, we refined our approach by applying the transformer model exclusively to free text, while structured data was handled only by rule-based methods. In this framework the DICOM validator dciodvfywas leveraged to ensure the integrity of DICOM files after the deID process. Through iterative refinement, including the incorporation of custom rules and private tag handling, the framework achieved a de-identification accuracy of 99.91% on the MIDI-B test dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining rule-based compliance with AI-enabled adaptability in addressing the complex challenges of DICOM de-identification.

Introduction Imaging plays a crucial role in numerous areas of medical and laboratory research, as well as clinical practice (Daoud and Otair, 2020). The growing access to medical images presents significant opportunities for research and devel- opment in healthcare. However, protecting patient pri- vacy remains critical. This is where medical image de- identification becomes important. It involves removing or obscuringPersonallyIdentifiableInformation(PII)andPro- tected Health Information (PHI) from medical images and their related metadata (Saint-Clair, 2022). PII includes di- rect identifiers such as names and birth dates, while PHI encompasses additional health-related identifiers such as medical record numbers and diagnostic codes (NCI, 2023).By effectively de-identifying medical images, we can safely share data for research, algorithm development, and other valuable purposes without compromising patient confiden- tiality (Saint-Clair, 2022). This paper presents our ap- proach to the Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B) challenge. MIDI-B offers a platform for develop- ing and evaluating state-of-the-art de-identification of Dig- ital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files using a large-scale, diverse data set aimed at accel- erating progress in this critical domain (Rutherford et al., 2021). 1 Haghiri et al., 2025 2.

    "ital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files using a large-scale, diverse data set aimed at accel- erating progress in this critical domain (Rutherford et al., 2021). 1 Haghiri et al., 2025 2. Related Works De-identification of medical images is a crucial step in en- suring privacy and compliance with data protection regula- tionssuchastheHealthInsurancePortabilityandAccount- ability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Reg- ulation (GDPR). Existing de-identification processes can be broadly classified into two main categories: DICOM header de-identification and pixel-level PII and PHI re- moval (Shahid et al., 2022). To prevent re-identification, these attributes must be de-identified while preserving data utility and compliance with DICOM standards (NEMA, 2023) From the literature, we identify three main approaches to develop de-identification methods: 2.1 Rule-Based DICOM De-identification Rule-based approaches have traditionally been the most widely used methods for de-identifying DICOM metadata. Free DICOM de-identification tools have been extensively analyzedinpreviousstudies,suchasAryantoetal. (Aryanto et al., 2015), where ten noncommercial DICOM toolkits were evaluated for their effectiveness in removing PHI from DICOMheaders. Thestudyfoundthatonlyfivetoolscould fullyde-identifyrequiredelements, withfourrequiringcare- ful customization. This highlights the limitations of rule- basedapproachesinensuringcompletede-identification, as different tools apply varying de-identification profiles with inconsistent results. While rule-based methods offer high interpretabilityandcompliancewithDICOMstandard,they often lack adaptability when dealing with unstructured or non-standard metadata. Additionally, they require ongoing maintenance to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards. 2.2 AI-based De-identification Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and nat- ural language processing (NLP) have facilitated AI-driven de-identification techniques. A systematic review by (Ko- vačević et al., 2024) analyzed AI-based de-identification methods for electronic health records (EHRs) from 2010 to 2023, covering 69 studies. The findings indicate that ML and hybrid models dominate the field, while rule-based approaches are less frequently used. The i2b2/UTHealth corpus, awidelyrecognizeddataset, remainsthemostcom- monly used benchmark for de-identification research. Ear- lier AI-based methods relied on feature engineering and hybrid rule-ML approaches, whereas recent advancements leverage attention-based neural networks, achieving F1- scores exceeding 98% on certain datasets. However, these modelsfacechallengesingeneralizingacrossdiverseclinical domains without additional manually labeled training data,raising concerns about their reliability in real-world applica- tions. The study emphasizes the importance of improving evaluation metrics and expanding training data diversity to enhance the robustness of AI-driven de-identification. Be- yond text-based de-identification, deep learning methods have been applied to pixel-level PHI removal, particularly for burned-in PHI (e.g., embedded text in medical images). (Khosravi et al., 2023) demonstrated the effectiveness of object detection models for radiographic marker removal while preserving essential medical annotations. However, AI-based de-identification also introduces challenges such as false positives, lack of interpretability, and regulatory concerns regarding automated data manipulation. 2.3 Hybrid AI-based and Rule-Based De-identification Hybrid approaches that combine rule-based and AI-driven techniques have been explored to enhance automation, ac- curacy,andregulatorycomplianceinde-identification. These approaches typically apply rule-based logic to structured metadata fields, while leveraging machine learning for un- structured or ambiguous cases. A recent example is Med- DiSC, an open-source tool that integrates rule-based meta- data de-identification, AI-based pixel data processing using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and automated DI- COM curation and segmentation (Dimoulakis et al., 2024). In MedDiSC, AI is primarily applied to the image level to detect and remove burned-in",
    "A recent example is Med- DiSC, an open-source tool that integrates rule-based meta- data de-identification, AI-based pixel data processing using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and automated DI- COM curation and segmentation (Dimoulakis et al., 2024). In MedDiSC, AI is primarily applied to the image level to detect and remove burned-in text, while metadata de- identification is handled through predefined rule sets. Our work adopts a hybrid approach that incorporates AI com- ponents for both metadata and pixel data de-identification, alongside rule-based mechanisms. This design reflects an effort to address unstructured information across multiple parts of the DICOM file, while maintaining alignment with existing standards. Further details are described in the fol- lowing sections. 3. Methods 3.1 Overview Our framework adopts a hybrid design, integrating a mod- ified prebuilt rule-based component, a robust OCR system, and a fine-tuned transformer-based model to handle both metadata and image content. It also incorporates a DI- COM validator to ensure post-deidentification DICOM in- tegrity. During the validation phase, we explored several modifications to improve performance. Initially, we em- ployed the DCMPS315Deidentifier, a modified prebuilt al- gorithm that adhered to the DICOM PS 3.15 confidential- ity guidelines (NEMA, 2023). However, due to subopti- mal performance scores, we developed a new algorithm, DCMTCIADeidentifier, based on the HIPAA Privacy Rule Safe Harbor method (DICOM PS 3.15 compliant) as de- 2 A Hybrid AI-based and Rule-based Approach to DICOM De-identification fined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) best prac- tices guidelines (TCIA, 2024). Another modification in- volved adjusting the application of components. At first, the transformer-based model and the rule-based compo- nent were jointly applied to both structured data and free text. However, this broad application did not yield opti- mal results. To address this, we refined the approach by restricting the transformer model to free text, while struc- tured data were handled exclusively by rule-based methods. These adjustments resulted in notable performance gains. The framework comprises several components, which will be detailed in the following section. 3.2 Components The de-identification framework is implemented through a set of components, each responsible for specific tasks in the de-identification process (see Figure 1). 3.2.1DCMDeidentifier This is the core component responsible for managing the entire de-identification workflow. It initializes all necessary de-identifiers and processes DICOM files across directo- ries, and computes the de-identified output paths. The de-identification process is triggered through a ‘run’ func- tion, which executes the following steps: Step 1: De-identify the metadata of DICOM files. Step 2: De-identify the image data by identifying and ob- scuring PHI detected within the images. Step 3: Validate DICOM files. Step 4: Export de-identified DICOM files to the appropri- ate directory. Additionally, the component exports a mapping of pa- tient IDs and UIDs to a CSV file for reference and audit purposes. 3.2.2DcmPHIDetector In this component, due to limited resources for developing a custom AI model from scratch, obi/deid_roberta_i2b2, a fine-tuned RoBERTa model trained on the I2B2 2014 dataset was employed (OBI, 2019). The RoBERTa model has been specifically fine-tuned for the de-identification of clinical data, leveraging the I2B2 2014 dataset, a bench- mark dataset",
    "component, due to limited resources for developing a custom AI model from scratch, obi/deid_roberta_i2b2, a fine-tuned RoBERTa model trained on the I2B2 2014 dataset was employed (OBI, 2019). The RoBERTa model has been specifically fine-tuned for the de-identification of clinical data, leveraging the I2B2 2014 dataset, a bench- mark dataset for medical text de-identification (Stubbs and Uzuner, 2015). RoBERTa, an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, excels in contextual understand- ing, enabling it to accurately identify and classify PHI enti- ties such as patient names, dates, and addresses (Liu et al., 2019). By detecting and removing these sensitive datapoints, the model ensures compliance with privacy regu- lations such as HIPAA, while preserving the utility of the medical data for research and analysis (Alsentzer et al., 2019). The model’s primary functions include: •Identifies PHI entities in the text. detect_entities •Removes or obscures the detected PHI entities from the DICOM tag values. deidentified_element_val 3.2.3DCMPS315Deidentifier Baselinerule-basedde-identificationalgorithm, builtontop ofdicomanonymizer.simpledicomanonymizer (Hau- mont,2023)andfollowstheApplicationLevelConfidential- ity Profile Attributes described in DICOM PS31.5 (NEMA, 2023). It customizes core operation functions to incor- porate the AI-based PHIDetector, enabling targeted de- identification of specific DICOM tags. Key features in- clude: Handling specific DICOM tags, such as those with Value Representations (VR) like \"LO\", \"LT\", \"SH\", \"PN\", \"CS\", \"ST\", \"UT\", where only PHI is replaced, leaving non-PHI text intact. Shifting date-related tags (e.g., those with \"DA\", \"DT\" VR) by a configurable number of days (default is 120 days). Ensuring consistency in patient IDs and UIDs by using mapping dictionaries. 3.2.4DCMTCIADeidentifier TheDCMTCIADeidentifier , islikeDCMPS315Deidentifier , but with the PS31.5 rules replaced by the rules from de- identification described by TCIA using HIPAA Privacy Rule Safe Harbor Method (DICOM PS 3.15 compliant) (TCIA, 2024). All available private tags are excluded and left un- modified for processing by the private tags de-identifier component. The use of the AI PHI detector is minimized for efficiency. Tags with the action rules \"replace\" and \"empty\", as well as those with Value Representations (VR) such as \"LO\", \"ST\", and \"LT\" are treated as free text. These tags are consolidated into a single medical note for- mat. The PHI detector is then applied to this combined document, and any identified sensitive information is re- placed with an empty string to ensure privacy. 3.2.5DCMTCIADeidentifier with Custom Rules In addition to the Safe Harbor Method table, TCIA out- lines several custom rules for de-identification. These in- clude the removal of sensitive information such as allergies, patient state, occupation, and all comment fields, while certain technical identifiers such as station name, device serial number, device UID, and plate ID must be retained. Overall, 40 custom rules were implemented based on these guidelines to enhance the precision and compliance of the de-identification process. 3 Haghiri et al., 2025 Figure 1: Core components of De-identification System. 3.2.6PrivateTagsDeidentifier This component utilizes a private tags dictionary provided by TCIA, containing 8,788 entries, to establish process- ing rules for private tags. Each private tag is evaluated based on its associated value representation and the pri- vate block in which it resides. These elements are com- bined to formulate a key",
    "This component utilizes a private tags dictionary provided by TCIA, containing 8,788 entries, to establish process- ing rules for private tags. Each private tag is evaluated based on its associated value representation and the pri- vate block in which it resides. These elements are com- bined to formulate a key and specific processing rule for each tag in the private tags dictionary. For example, a sample private tag dictionary key might be formatted as \"(0009,gems_petd_01,2b)_SL,\" where {tag group}, {pri- vate block}, and {last 2 digits of tag element} are linked to a specific {VR}. No AI-based PHI detection is applied during the de-identification of private tags. 3.2.7DCMImageDeidentifier This component is responsible for the de-identification of imagedatawithinDICOMfiles. ItemploysthePaddleOCR tool(PaddleOCR,2023)toextracttextfromDICOMslices. PaddleOCR is a comprehensive OCR system that supports various text detection and recognition tasks. It is known for its accuracy, speed, and ease of use, making it suitable for processing large volumes of images, such as DICOM slices in medical imaging. The tool is built on deep learn- ing techniques and can handle a wide range of languages and text orientations, which is particularly important in medical imaging, where text may not always be aligned in a standard way. The extracted text is then processed by thePHIDetector , and if any PHI is detected, the corre- sponding bounding boxes within the images are filled with color from the neighboring pixel to obscure the sensitive information.3.2.8DCMValidator This component employs dciodvfy (Clunie, 2021) to en- sure the integrity of DICOM files after the de-identification process. If validation errors arise due to missing attributes, the corresponding tags are added to the DICOM file with an empty value to maintain compliance and completeness. 3.3 Challenges and Solutions During the validation phase, our PHI detector occasion- ally generated false positives. For instance, terms such as “MR BREAST” were frequently misclassified as person’s name. Tomitigatesucherrors, weimplementedawhitelist- based filtering strategy. Specifically, we compiled a list of 150 imaging-related terms—including “CT,” “MR,” “T1,” “abdomen,” and others—based on labeled anatomical case names extracted from an article by Hacking et al. (2018). Detected entities overlapping with this curated vocabulary were excluded from the final PHI detection, thereby reduc- ingfalsepositiverateswithoutcompromisingthesensitivity of the de-identification process. Additionally, after evaluating the performance on the validationdatawenoticedsomeofthe\"MissingAttributes\" errors by the DCMValidator component were not relevant to the validation output. E.g. ’CodeValue’, ’Manufac- turer’, ’ClinicalTrialSubjectID’. We decided to maintain an ignore list of such Missing Attribute tags and choose to ignore them while populating such tags after DICOM vali- dation. 4 A Hybrid AI-based and Rule-based Approach to DICOM De-identification 4.

The runtimes of our de-identification algorithms are presented on Table 4. Togaininsightsintothefailuresofourde-identification algorithm, we analyzed all of the 8,676 mismatches from the test data that are reported in the discrepancy report generated by the MIDI-B validation script. The first pie chart (Figure: 2) illustrates the distribution of these fail- ures across four distinct categories: the majority (5,145 cases, 59.3%) stemmed from limitations in PHI detection, indicating missed identification of sensitive information. A substantial number of failures (3,195 cases, 36.8%) were attributed to incorrect handling of private DICOM tags, highlighting the need for a more robust and comprehen- 5 Haghiri et al., 2025 sive rule set tailored to these vendor-specific elements. An additional 272 mismatches (3.1%) resulted from inconsis- tencies flagged during DICOM validation, and 64 failures (0.7%) were caused by incomplete or inappropriately ap- plied custom rules. The second pie chart (Figure: 3) presents the distribu- tion of the check_score values associated with these mis- matched tags, a metric that reflects the degree of similar- ity between the expected and the algorithm’s de-identified output. A total of 2,528 tags (49.1%) received a check score of 0.0, indicating a complete mismatch. Scores in the range of 0.25–0.4 accounted for 582 tags (11.3%), while 204 tags (3.9%) fell within the 0.4–0.5 range. Moderate similarity (check scores between 0.5–0.7) was observed in 305 tags (5.9%), and 1,130 tags",

Notably, 395 tags (7.6%) achieved high similarity (0.8–0.99), suggesting mi- nor deviations from the expected output. These findings underscore the varying degrees of error severity and offer targeted directions for improving both PHI detection and content-preserving transformation strategies.

Discussion The development of a robust de-identification framework for DICOM files presents unique challenges, particularly in balancing patient privacy with data utility. Our approach to the MIDI-B challenge highlights both the strengths and limitations of relying on transformer-based models for PHI detection. While AI-based methods such as RoBERTa demonstrate strong performance in identifying PHI in free- text contexts, their effectiveness diminishes when applied Figure 3: Check Score Distribution to structured metadata fields common in DICOM files. These cases often require complementary rule-based logic to ensure accurate de-identification. The iterative refine- mentsappliedthroughoutthechallengeledtoprogressively improved results, underscoring the importance of a hybrid, adaptive approach. Our final model achieved an excep- tionally high score of 99.91%, indicating near-perfect de- identification on the provided test set. However, despite this strong performance, it is impor- tant to acknowledge that this score may not generalize across all data sources or clinical settings. DICOM meta- data varies widely depending on modality, institution, and vendor-specific implementations. Therefore, evaluating de- identification approaches across diverse datasets remains a critical challenge. Future work could explore fine-tuning PHI detection models specifically on DICOM metadata rather than re- lying on models that are trained on general clinical data. Such models, trained on DICOM-specific formats and se- mantics, may better distinguish between sensitive informa- tion and domain-specific terminology, thereby improving generalizability and robustness across varied use cases.
