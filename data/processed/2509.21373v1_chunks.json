    "1 Interface and Thermophysical Properties of R32 Refrigerant Abibat Adekoya -Olowofela1,2, Sukriti Manna1,2†, Subramanian KRS Sankaranarayanan1,2, * 1Center for Nanoscale Materials, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States 2Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60607, United States Corresponding Authors : †smanna@uic.edu *skrssank@uic.edu Abstract Driven by the urgent demand for efficient cooling in microelectronics and advanced thermal management systems, difluoromethane (R32/CH 2F2) has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its favorable thermophysical properties, including high heat transfer efficiency and low viscosity. While bulk properties such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity have been widely studied, interfacial properties including surface tension and interfacial thickness remain comparatively underexplored, despite their importance in phase -transition dynamics. Here, w e perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from 180 K-300 K using an optimized transferable force field for fluoropr openes with enhanced electrostatics to assess both bulk and interfacial behavior of R32. Simulations reproduced density within  2.1%, viscosity within 3.05%, and thermal conductivity within 7.41% of NIST reference data. Heat capacities (C p and C v) were predicted within 5%. For interfacial properties, surface tension trends were reproduced within 15.8% deviation, and the vapor -liquid coexistence curve closely matched reference data, yielding a critical temperature of 345.7 K (1.6% deviation) and a critical density of 0.397 g /cm³ (6.4% deviation). Importantly, the vapor -liquid interface exhibited strong temperature dependence, with interfacial thickness increasing by 290% between 180 K and 290 K. These validated results provide predictive molecular -level insights, particularly for interfacial properties that remain less characterized. By reducing property prediction errors in key parameters such as critical temperature, this work provides reliable inputs for heat-exchanger and system models. Such correlations can support optimized component sizing, improved performance, and reduced refrigerant charge. Beyond R32, the methodology offers a transferable framework for blended and next -generation low -GWP refrigerants, contributing to sustainable thermal management a ligned with the 2027 EU F -Gas regulation and 2030 Kigali Amendment.

Introduction High -performance microelectronics and data -intensive computing platforms face growing challenges in dissipating heat as device dimensions shrink and power densities rise 1–4. Traditional heat transfer fluids often lack the thermophysical balance needed for compact, high -efficiency cooling architectures 5–9. Difluoromethane (R32, CH 2F2) has emerged as a promising working fluid for advanced thermal management, offering high heat transfer efficiency, relatively low viscosity, and good dielectric stability - making it well -suited for applications such as two -phase immersion cooling, microchannel heat exchangers, and chip -level heat removal. In addition to its favorable performance characteristics, R32 also carries a comparatively low global warming potential (GWP = 677), pro viding an environmentally advantageous alternative to conventional high -GWP fluids while meeting the stringent thermal demands of next - generation microelectronics. Beyond its environmental advantages, R32 offers excellent thermodynamic behavior, including higher volumetric cooling capacity, superior heat transfer, and improved energy efficiency, making it an attractive option for low -temperature cooling across a",
    "advantageous alternative to conventional high -GWP fluids while meeting the stringent thermal demands of next - generation microelectronics. Beyond its environmental advantages, R32 offers excellent thermodynamic behavior, including higher volumetric cooling capacity, superior heat transfer, and improved energy efficiency, making it an attractive option for low -temperature cooling across a broad range of energy applications 10–12. A detailed analysis of the thermophysical properties of R32, such as density, viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, surface tension, interfacial thickness, and vapor -liquid equilibrium (VLE), is important for RAC machine design and efficiency. Th ese properties directly influence refrigeration systems' flow characteristics, boiling, and condensation processes, ultimately determining heating , ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVACR) systems’ performance 13–17. For example, both boiling and condensation processes are impacted by surface tension; a drop in surface tension enables easier nucleate boiling and increased heat transfer 18,19. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven to be powerful tools for predicting bulk properties such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of refrigerants under varying conditions 20–23. However, interfacial properties such as surface tension and interfacial thickness remain comparatively underexplored, despite their critical role in phase -transition dynamics. Moreover, discrepancies in accurately predicting R32’s critical temperature an d VLE behavior highlight the need for further investigation 24. This work addresses these gaps through a comprehensive MD -based study of R32 refrigerant spanning 180 K-300 K, covering a wide range of operational conditions relevant to RAC systems. We use an enhanced force -field parameterization with explicit bond stretching and bending terms , alongside larger simulation system sizes (up to 2,000 molecules for bulk and slab geometries with extended vacuum spacing) , thereby improving interfacial property accuracy over prior MD studies. Our primary objective is to establish VLE behavior to clarify phase transitions and critical properties, while also examining interfacial properties to evaluate phase sepa ration and molecular -scale dynamics. In addition, temperature - dependent bulk properties such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity are investigated to provide deeper insight into R32’s thermodynamic behavior. By linking molecular -scale understanding with practical design, this work aims to provide correlations for viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension that can be integrated into heat -exchanger models. Such correlations will enable manufacturers to optimize component s izing, enhance coefficients of performance, and reduce refrigerant charge, ultimately lowering energy consumption in residential and commercial HVAC equipment. In doing so, our study not only advances scientific knowledge of the properties and atomistic scale behavior of R32 but also delivers practical insights to engineers, modelers, and policymakers working toward more efficient, climate -friendly refrigeration and air -conditioning technologies. 3 II. Computational Details and Methodology We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the interfacial and thermophysical properties of pure R32 refrigerant using the LAMMPS software package 25. Molecular interactions were described with the Rabbe et al. force field, which incorporates bond stretching, angle bending, and non - bonded interactions 26.

    "Molecular interactions were described with the Rabbe et al. force field, which incorporates bond stretching, angle bending, and non - bonded interactions 26. These terms preserved molecular geometry and flexibility while capturing dispersion and electrostatics, providing a faithful and transferable description of R32. Table 1 summarizes the specific parameters for bond stretching, angle bending, and non -bonded interactions, while Lorentz -Berthelot mixing rules estimate cross -interactions between dissimilar atoms 27. The molecular geometry and system configurations were designed to accurately capture both bulk and interfacial behavior of R32. Figure 1a shows the molecular geometry of R32 used in this study. For the bulk configuration, 2000 R32 molecules were randomly placed using Packmol 28 in a cubic simulation box of dimensions 5 nm × 5 nm × 5 nm ( Figure 1b). Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions to maintain a bulk phase free of surface effects. To study interfacial properties such as surface tension and interfacial thickness, a modified configuration was created. The simulation box was expanded in the z -direction to 5 nm × 5 nm × 20 nm, with 10 nm of vacuum introduced above and below the refriger ant slab, as illustrated in Figure 1c 29. Table 1 .

Simulation Protocols and Parameters for Thermophysical and Interface Property Analysis of R32 We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Large -scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) 25 to investigate the interfacial and thermophysical properties of the R32 refrigerant across a range of operational temperature regimes. Each system underwent initial energy minimization to obtain a relaxed configuration, ensuring a physically meaningful state . Equilibration was then carried out in the NPT ensemble (constant particle number, pressure, and temperature) at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 180 to 300 K until both thermal and structural equilibrium were achieved. At each temperature, the proto col included a 1 ns equilibration run followed by a 4 ns production run for property evaluation, with a 1 fs timestep maintained throughout.

    "both thermal and structural equilibrium were achieved. At each temperature, the proto col included a 1 ns equilibration run followed by a 4 ns production run for property evaluation, with a 1 fs timestep maintained throughout. Intermolecular interactions were modeled with a 12 Å cutoff, long -range Coulombic terms were treated using Ewald summation with a tolerance of 10⁻⁴, and temperature and pressure were regulated using the Nose -Hoover thermostat and barostat30. Density Profile and Interfacial Thickness We analyzed density profiles along the z -axis to characterize the liquid -vapor interface of R32 . This analysis provides insight into molecular arrangements at the interface and enables estimation of the 5 interfacial thickness. The liquid refrigerant was positioned at the center of the simulation box, with vacuum regions introduced above and below, as illustrated in Figure 1c. To obtain the density profile 𝜌(𝑧), the simulation box was partitioned into 156 bins along the z -axis, and the number of R32 molecules in each bin was used to compute local densities. This procedure yielded continuous density distributions that resolved bulk liquid, interfacial, and vapor regions 31 . The transition zone between the bulk liquid and vapor phases was quantified by fitting the density profile 𝜌(𝑧) with a hyperbolic tangent function 29: 𝜌(𝑧)=1 2(𝜌𝑙+𝜌𝑣)±1 2(𝜌𝑙−𝜌𝑣)tanh (𝑧−𝑧0 𝑑) (1) where 𝜌𝑙 and 𝜌𝑣 are the bulk densities of liquid and vapor phases, respectively, 𝑧0 is the midpoint of the interface where the density is halfway between, 𝜌𝑙 and 𝜌𝑣 and d represent the average interfacial thickness (Figure 2a). Following the 10/90 criterion 29, d was defined as the z -region over which the density profile varied between 𝜌𝑣+0.1(𝜌𝑙−𝜌𝑣) to 𝜌𝑣+0.9(𝜌𝑙+𝜌𝑣) 32 (2) After establishing the density profile and interfacial thickness, the coexistence of liquid and vapor phases was examined to construct the vapor –liquid equilibrium (VLE) curve. Vapor -Liquid Equilibrium We established the phase coexistence behavior of R32 by simulating liquid and vapor phases coexisting in the same system (Figure 1a). This configuration allowed us to directly measure equilibrium densities in the bulk liquid 𝜌𝑙 and vapor 𝜌𝑣 regions across the studied temperature range. We used these densities to construct the vapor -liquid coexistence curve. Near the critical temperature, the density difference between liquid and vapor phases was described using a scaling law 31, 33: (𝜌𝑙−𝜌𝑣)= 𝐴 (𝑇𝑐−𝑇)𝛽 (3) where A is a fitting constant, T is the temperature, Tc is the critical temperature, and β is the critical exponent that characterizes the critical behavior of the phase transition. Additionally, the law of rectilinear diameters 34 was applied to obtain the critical density: 1 2(𝜌𝑙+𝜌𝑣)= 𝜌𝑐 +𝐵 (𝑇𝑐−𝑇) (4) where c is the critical density, B is a fitting constant, T is the temperature. By combining equations 3 and 4, the critical temperature T c, critical density c, and constants A, B, and  were computed, which together defined the complete VLE curve for R32. This curve provides detailed insight into the phase -transition characteristics of R32, which are essential for applications requiring the stable coexistence of liquid and vapor phases.

This curve provides detailed insight into the phase -transition characteristics of R32, which are essential for applications requiring the stable coexistence of liquid and vapor phases. Following the phase -behavior analysis, we turned to the evaluation of t ransport properties. Thermal Transport Properties: Thermal Conductivity and Viscosity We calculated thermal transport properties, namely, thermal conductivity (κ) and viscosity (η), using equilibrium MD simulations according to the Green -Kubo formalism 35,36. This approach establishes a relationship between the transport coefficients and the time integrals of both heat flux and shear stress autocorrelation functions. Thermal conductivity was determined from the relation : 𝑘=𝑽 𝑲𝑩𝑻𝟐∫<𝐽𝑥(0)𝐽𝑥(𝑡)>𝑑𝑡∞ 0 (5) where Jx is the heat flux vector, V is the system volume, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. We equilibrated each state point for 1 ns in the NVT ensemble and then performed a 7 ns NVE 6 simulation to generate heat flux trajectories. The autocorrelation function <𝐽𝑥(0)𝐽𝑥(𝑡)> was computed and integrated to estimate κ. Viscosity was calculated using an equivalent Green -Kubo scheme: 𝜂=𝑉 𝐾𝐵𝑇∫<𝑃𝛼𝛽(0)𝑃𝛼𝛽(𝑡)>𝑑𝑡∞ 0 (6) where 𝑃𝛼𝛽 are the off -diagonal components of the pressure tensor representing shear stress. As with thermal conductivity, e ach viscosity calculation included a 1 ns NVT equilibration followed by a 7 ns NVE production run. The autocorrelation of the stress tensor was then computed and integrated to yield η. Interfacial properties were subsequently evaluated using the same configuration. Surface Tension We calculated surface tension (γ) from the interfacial configuration (Fig ure 1c). The liquid refrigerant slab was placed centrally in the simulation box with 10 Å vacuum layers extending along the z -direction to form a liquid -vapor interface. The system was equilibrated in the NVT ensemble until thermal equilibrium was achieved. Following equilibration, an NVT production run was performed, and pressure tensor components were recorded. Surface tension was computed from the anisotropy of the pres sure tensor by integrating the difference between the normal and tangential pressure components across the interfacial region 33,37: 𝛾=1 2∫(𝑃𝑁∞ −∞(𝑧)−𝑃𝑇(𝑧))𝑑𝑧 (7) where 𝑃𝑁 and 𝑃𝑧 are the normal and tangential components of the pressure tensor across the interface, and z represents the coordinate perpendicular to the interface. The factor 1/2 accounts for the two interfaces present in the simulation box due to periodic boundary conditions. This approach allowed for the measurement of surface tension across different temperatures. Finally, heat capacities were calculated to complete the thermody namic characterization. Heat Capacity Calculations We determined the heat capacities at constant volume (Cv) and constant pressure ( Cp) from thermodynamic data obtained through MD simulations in the NVT and NPT ensembles, respectively . A cubic polynomial fit was applied to energy data, enabling estimation of the heat capacities through analytical differentiation 38,39 40.

For C v, simulations were performed in the NVT ensemble to maintain constant system volume and eliminate work contributions from external forces. Temperature fluctuations were used to sample the total energy (E) over a range of temperatures, and the corresponding energy values were extracted from the MD trajectories . For Cp, simulations were carried out in the NPT ensemble, allowing for volume fluctuations at constant pressure. Enthalpy (H) values were recorded across different temperatures and subsequentl y analyzed.

Once the coefficients were determined, heat capacities were calculated as the first derivatives of the polynomials with respect to temperature. 7 The isochoric heat capacity Cv was thus expressed as 40: 𝐶𝑣=𝜕𝐸 𝜕𝑇=𝑏1+2𝑏2𝑇+3𝑏3𝑇2 (10) and the isobaric heat capacity C p as: 𝐶𝑝=𝜕𝐻 𝜕𝑇=𝑎1+2𝑎2𝑇+3𝑎3𝑇2 (11) Substituting the polynomial coefficients into these expressions yielded Cv and C p values at each studied temperature. III. Results and Discussion In this section, we present the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results for difluoromethane (R32), focusing on interfacial, thermophysical, and transport properties relevant to its performance as a cooling fluid for microelectronics and advanced thermal management systems. Our analysis spans density profiles, interfacial thickness, surface tension, vapor -liquid equilibrium (VLE), transport properties (thermal conductivity and viscosity), and heat capacities. Where possible, our results are benchmarked against experimental data and previous MD studies to assess the accuracy and predictive power of the employed force field. Density Profile and Interfacial Thickness Before evaluating transport behavior, we first examined the molecular -scale structure of the liquid -vapor interface. Figure 2a shows the density profile of the vapor -liquid interface of R32, which we inspected to assess molecular layering and the extent of phase separation. The resulting profile reveals a sharp high - density plateau in the liquid phase, a well -defined low -densi ty plateau in the vapor phase, and a transition region connecting the two. In Figure 2b, we compared the calculated bulk liquid densi ties with NIST data 41. Our simulations slightly underestimated density at lower temperatures but progressively converged toward the reference values at higher temperatures, reflecting improved accuracy at elevated conditions . We also observe pronounced temperature -dependent changes in interfacial thickness. At lower temperatures, strong intermolecular forces generate d a distinct and well -separated interface, producing a comparatively thin transition region. At higher temperatures, by contrast, increased molecular kinetic energy combined with weaker cohesive forces promoted greater diffusion of molecules across the inte rface, leading to a broader interfacial width ( Figure 2c and Figure 2d). This systematic increase in interfacial thickness with temperature is consistent with an independent MD study 42, confirming that our results fall within the expected range of simulation uncertainty. As we approach the critical region of R32 , the density contrast",

This systematic increase in interfacial thickness with temperature is consistent with an independent MD study 42, confirming that our results fall within the expected range of simulation uncertainty. As we approach the critical region of R32 , the density contrast between liquid and vapor diminishe s further, and the interface bec omes increasingly diffuse. The simultaneous thickening of the transition region and the disappearance of surface tension at criticality allow for enhanced molecular interpenetration and exchange across phases, which is a hallmark of critical behavior. 8 Figure 2 Density Profiles and Liquid Phase Behavior of R32.

(c) Snapshots of liquid and vapor phase coexistence for two representative temperatures, 210 K and 220 K, illustrat ing the width of the interface and the phase separation behavior. A noticeable broadening of the interface at the higher temperature (290 K) is observed, reflecting increased molecular motion and a reduced density contrast between the liquid and vapor phases. Surface Tension We next calculated the surface tension of R32 and compared it with NIST reference values. Fig ure 3a presents the temperature dependence of surface tension, showing a clear decreasing trend with increasing temperature. Our simulations produced values that decreased from 0.029 Nm-1 at 180 K to 0.0098 N/m at 280 K. These results reproduce d the well -known temperature dependence of surface tension and align closely with NIST data. To further validate our model, we compared our results with the independent MD 9 study by Cai et al . 42. At 200 K, their reported values f ell below the reference curve , while our results l ay in between, lending confidence to the accuracy of our approach. We quantified the deviations by calculating the RMSD, which was 0.00264 N/m across the studied range. This value is negligible compared to the absolute surface tension and confirms that our simulations reliably capture the behavior . Agreement with reference data was strong below 220 K, with only minor deviations. At higher temperatures (260 -280 K), our model slightly underestimated surface tension, and discrepancies became more noticeable with increasing temperature. However, these deviations remained within the accepted limits of molecular simulations and are most likely attributable to limi tations of the force field at elevated temperatures. Overall, th e results confirm that the simulation framework is robust and effective in predicting surface tension trends across a wide temperature range. Figure 3.

Simulated results are compared against reference experimental values, with the critical point marked for both datasets. Vapor -Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) Building on the interfacial analyses, we then constructed the vapor –liquid coexistence curve of R32 to quantify its two -phase behavior. We constructed the vapor -liquid coexistence curve (VLE) of R32 to describe its two -phase behavior , as shown in Figure 3b . With increasing temperature, the liquid density l decreased, reflecting thermal expansion characteristic of most liquids, while the vapor density v increased correspondingly. These trends merged at the critical point, where both phases attained equival ent densities. Our MD simulations produced a VLE curve in close agreement with experimental observations across the studied temperature range. From this analysis, the critical temperature Tc and critical density c were determined to be 345.7 K and 0.397 g/cm3, respectively, consistent with experimental critical values (Tc=351.26 K, c = 0.424 g/cm3). The liquid and vapor density trends were effectively captured, with discrepancies remaining within an acceptable range. The high level of agreement with experimental 10 observations validates the ability of the simulation model to describe the dual -phase behavior of the refrigerant and its engineering -relevant thermophysical properties. Thermal Conductivity and Viscosity We extended the analysis from equilibrium and interfacial properties to transport behavior. In particular , we evaluated the thermal conductivity of R32. Figure 4a shows the decay of the heat flux autocorrelation function with time at different temperatures, and Figure 4b presents the calculated thermal conductivity values across the studied range . Both the simulation output and referenced values depict the expected decrease in thermal conductivity with increas ing temperature. The referenced values ranged from 0.22 W/m at 180 K to 0.16 W/m at 250 K. Our calculated results reproduce this behavior with deviations of 7.77 % at low temperatures and 6.04% at elevated tempe ratures. The mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPE) across all studied temperatures was 7.41% . This agreement highlights the effectiveness of the model in capturing the thermal conductivity behavior of R32. Figure 4c illustrates the stress autocorrelation function used to evaluate viscosity, and Fig ure 4d compares the resulting values with referenced benchmarks. Both datasets show a clear decrease in viscosity with increasing temperature, from approximately 0.0005 Pa·s at 180 K to 0.0002 Pa·s at 250 K. The simulations reproduced this trend with excellent agreement, yielding a MAPE of 3.05% and individual deviations not exceeding 7.41%. This strong agreement confirms the accuracy of the model in capturing the viscosity behavior of R32. 11 Figure 4. Thermal Conductivity and Viscosity",

Isochoric (C v) and Isobaric (C p) Heat Capacities Finally, to evaluate the energetic and heat storage properties of R32, we computed isochoric (Cv) and isobaric ( Cp) heat capacities under ambient pressure conditions. These quantities are essential for assessing refrigerant energy storage and heat transfer performance, and they directly impact refrigeration cycle efficiency . Figure 5 compares the simulated Cv and Cp values with NIST reference data across the 230 -300 K temperature range, with Cv shown in Fig ure 5a and Cp in Figure 5b. Our simulations reproduce d the expected temperature dependence of both properties with strong agreement with reference values. For Cv, 12 we observed minor deviations that varied across the temperature range , while Cp closely follow ed the reference trend throughout. These results confirm that the MD simulations reliably capture heat capacity behavior alongside the other thermophysical properties investigated. Figure 5.

Conclusion We investigated the interfacial and thermophysical properties of R32 refrigerant using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results for density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, surface tension, and vapor –liquid equilibrium (VLE) showed excellent agreement with NIST reference data across a wide temperature range. As expected, interfacial width increased with temperature, while surface tension, viscosity, and thermal conductivity decreased. The calculated heat capacities (C v and C p) agreed closely with experi mental values. The VLE curve accurately reproduced the phase behavior of R32, including its critical temperature and density. Together, these results validate the robustness of our methodology and support its predictive power for refrigerant phase transiti ons.
