September 11, 2025 In this work, we search for empirical relationships for irre gular dwarf galaxies using a collection of observational data published in the NASA and H yperLeda databases. Us- ing a complex statistical analysis, we calculated correlat ion coeﬃcients between various physical parameters of irregular dwarf galaxies. We found s trong correlations between mass and distance, apparent stellar magnitude and distance , mass and absolute mag- nitude, redshift, and mass for all types of irregular dwarf g alaxies as well as for their individual types. Keywords : irregular dwarf galaxies, empirical dependencies, corre lation, heliocentric velocity, redshift, HyperLeda database, catalog. 1 Introduction In the universe, among the diﬀerent types of galaxies, there are d warf galaxies con- sisting of a few billion stars with luminosities less than 109L⊙(Kutlimuratov et al. 2020). Most often dwarf galaxies are those whose absolute stellar magnitude does not exceed −16m. Therefore, it is very diﬃcult to observe dwarf galaxies at large distances (Zasov, 1984). Currently, many papers have been published on dwarf galaxies. For example, be- sides, the ﬁrst catalog of dwarf galaxies was published in the paper ( van den Bergh, 1959). Van den Bergh’s catalog (van den Bergh, 1959) includes all lo w-surface bright- ness galaxies that are present on the Palomar Sky Survey. In the c atalogue (Mateo, 1998), the author discusses detailed properties of dwarf galaxies , including (a) the integral photometric parameters and optical structures of the se galaxies, (b) the con- tent, nature, and distribution of their interstellar medium, (c) the ir abundances of heavy elements, (d) their complex and diverse star formation histo ries, (e) their in- ternal kinematics, emphasising the relevance of these galaxies to t he ‘dark matter problem’ and alternative interpretations, and (f) evidence of pas t, current and fu- ture interactions of these dwarfs with other galaxies in the Local G roup and beyond. This paper (McConnachie, 2012) presents a comprehensive analys is of the positional, ∗Email: tillaboyev k@nuu.uzarXiv:2509.08751v1 [astro-ph.GA] 10 Sep 2025 EMPIRICAL DEPENDENCIES FOR IRR.

These galaxies cover a wide range of environments, from satellites of the Milky Way and Andromeda to isolated systems in the neighborho od of the Local Group.

    "explores the spatial str ucture and sub- group membership in the Local Group, examining the morphological d iversity and orbital history of these galaxies. In addition, the scale relations an d trends in stellar metallicity are investigated, including the existence of a possible lower limit to the central surface brightness and metallicity at faint magnitudes. In (Poulain et al, 2021), the sample consists of 2210 dwarfs. The au thors deﬁne the nucleus as a compact source close to the photocentre of the g alaxy(within 0 .5Re), which is also the brightest such source within the eﬀective radius of t he galaxy. We performed a morphological analysis by modeling the two-dimensional surface bright- ness proﬁle in g-band images of both galaxies and nuclei. The study (G uo et al, 2024) presents a comprehensive catalogue of 3459 nearby blue star-fo rming dwarf galaxies derived from SDSS DR16, focusing on the evolution of their metallicity , an area less studied in dwarf galaxy studies. The authors apply strict selection c riteria based on redshift, stellar mass, absolute magnitude, optical diameter, a nd emission line signal-to-noise ratio to create a sample from the higher-mass end o f the dwarf galaxy spectrum. Despite the range of metallicities, the average metallicity was found to be about 0.2 dex below solar, indicating relatively mature chemical evolut ion. But the information in such catalogues is not suﬃcient for a complete physical study of dwarf irregular galaxies. Especially there is no catalogue on separate mor- phological types of dwarf galaxies. Based on the study of existing c atalogues, we have created a special summary catalogue of dwarf galaxies containing 4 13 objects. Based on this catalogue, we calculated correlation coeﬃcients between th e main physical characteristics of irregular dwarf galaxies. 2 Find empirical dependences Using data from the Special summary catalogue of dwarf galaxies co ntaining 413 ob- jects, we calculated correlation coeﬃcients between the main phys ical characteristics of irregular dwarf galaxies. According to the data in Figure 1, the majority of the objects are ir regular mor- phological type dwarf galaxies. The number of spiral dwarf galaxies is also high, and the histogram shows several of their types. Based on our data, we found a linear dependence of some quantities for irregular dwarf galaxies. When the relationship between mass and distance (c orrelation 0.95) was studied, the following relationship was obtained: log(M/MSun) = 0.0230(±0.0006)·D+0.7840(±0.0504) (1) It is evident that with increasing distances the mass of irregular dwa rf galaxies in- creases. 52 TILLABOEV, TADJIBAEV AND OTOJANOVA Figure 1 Histogram of the distribution of dwarf galaxies by morphological typ es. An empirical relationship between apparent stellar magnitude and dis tance was also found (the correlation coeﬃcient is 0.58): mB= 0.0206(±0.0025)·D+16.0010(±0.1953) (2) The dependence (2) shows that the brighter or larger the stellar m agnitude of the galaxy, the further away they are. The errors in determining the c oeﬃcients are quite acceptable. Further, we have analyzed the statistical dependence of the gala xy mass on the absolute stellar magnitude of the galaxy itself.

    "the stellar m agnitude of the galaxy, the further away they are. The errors in determining the c oeﬃcients are quite acceptable. Further, we have analyzed the statistical dependence of the gala xy mass on the absolute stellar magnitude of the galaxy itself. We have found the fo llowing empirical dependence by the least squares method (correlation equal to -0 .58): log(M/MSun) =−0.6670(±0.0784)·Mv−1.4975(±1.2965) (3) As can be seen, the logarithmic mass of galaxies increases with increa sing absolute magnitude within the linear law. Obviously, the values of the absolute stellar magnitude should corre late with the redshift of the mass. Calculation of this empirical dependence show s that (correlation 0.95): z= 0.0094(±0.0002)·log(M/MSun)−0.7270(±0.0025) (4) It can be seen that here the coeﬃcient determination errors are q uite acceptable. The above results were calculated for all irregular dwarf galaxies in t he list. In ordertocomparethese results, the irregulardwarflawsarein the list ofdividends into your parts.

The correlation increases slightly in the type code = 10 group (0.95→0.98), indicating a stronger relationship between mass and distance in this subset. Conversely, the correlation decreases signiﬁcantly in the type code 9.5–9.9 group (0.95 →0.82), suggesting a weaker relationship. Apparent magnitude vs. Distance. The correlation improves slightly in the type code = 10 group (0.58 →0.62). For the type code 9.5–9.9 group, the correlation is not observed. Mass vs. Absolute magnitude. The negative correlation strengthens slightly in the type code = 10 group ( | −0.58| → | −0.63|). In the type code 9.5–9.9 group, the correlation increases dramatically ( |−0.58| → |−0.91|), indicating a signiﬁcantly stronger negative relationship between visual magnitude and mass . Redshift vs. Mass. The correlation increases in the type code = 10 group (0.95 →0.98), reﬂecting a stronger relationship. In contrast, it decreas es in the type code 9.5–9.9 group (0.95 →0.81), indicating a weaker connection. 3 Conclusions This study provides a detailed examination of the empirical dependen cies among physical parameters of irregular dwarf galaxies, revealing signiﬁca nt correlations that enhance our understanding of their properties and behavior.
