    "1 Data-driven optimization of pixelated CdZnTe spectrometers for uranium enrichment assay Jayson R. Vavrek, Thomas D. MacDonald, Hannah S. Parrilla, Nikhil S. Deshmukh, Mital A. Zalavadia, Benjamin S. McDonald Abstract—In recent work [Vavrek et al. (2025)], we devel- oped the performance optimization frameworkspectre-ml for gamma spectrometers with variable performance across many readout channels. The framework uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and clustering to learn groups of similarly- performing channels and sweep through various learned channel combinations to optimize the performance tradeoff of including worse-performing channels for better total efficiency. In this work, we integrate thepyGEMuranium enrichment assay code with ourspectre-mlframework, and show that the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. We find that this optimization reduces relative uncertainties after a30-minute measurement by an average of20%, as tested on six different H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which can significantly improve uranium non- destructive assay measurement times in nuclear safeguards con- texts. Additionally, this work demonstrates that thespectre-ml optimization framework can accommodate arbitrary end-user spectroscopic analysis code and performance metrics, enabling future optimizations for complex Pu spectra. I. INTRODUCTION The H3D M400 gamma spectrometer [1] is being adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as its primary in-field uranium enrichment non-destructive assay (NDA) technology [2], [3], [4]. The M400 features four CdZnTe (CZT) crystals each pixelated to an11×11grid, and offers medium resolution gamma spectroscopy at room temperature in a compact form factor. In previous work, we showed that the spatial variations in detector performance within the CZT crystal volumes could be exploited to op- timize spectroscopic performance metrics [5]. In particular, a balance can be found between identifying and rejecting poorly-performing detector regions and the associated loss of efficiency. Because of the large number of possible voxel combinations (∼107285), computing the globally optimum set of voxels to include is infeasible, and approximate, data-driven methods were developed. Several of the example optimizations therein focused on minimizing the relative uncertainty in a peak fit amplitude parameter as proofs of concept in lieu of more advanced spectral performance metrics. In this work, we have integrated our spectroscopic optimiza- tion softwarespectre-mlwithGEM[6], the actual software used by the IAEA to conduct uranium NDA measurements.

This paper is structured as follows: Section II covers the integration of thespectre-mlandGEMcodes at a high level, discussing recent improvements to the former to bet- ter enable arbitrary end-user workflows, and providing an overview of theGEMworkflow itself.

Section III gives the results of sixGEM-based spectre-mloptimizations for six M400 units, showing that the enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. Section IV then provides additional interpretation of the results, discusses some limitations, and suggests avenues for further work. Finally, the Appendix gives a pseudocode overview of how an end-user can integrate their own spectrum analyses into thespectre-mloptimization framework. II. METHODS A. Integration of thespectre-mlandpyGEMcodes Thespectre-ml[5], [7] code is a Python package for op- timizing the performance of many-channel gamma spectrom- eters by intelligently rejecting data from poorly-performing detector channels (i.e., spatial regions). It uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [8], [9] and unsupervised clus- tering algorithms to learn groups of voxels with similar per- formance, compute performance metrics across various voxel cluster combinations, and then sweep over hyperparameters such as clustering algorithm, number of clusters, number of NMF components, etc., to find the best overall set of voxels to include. Previous versions ofspectre-mlwere restricted to single Doniach [10] or Gaussian peak fit workflows us- ing thebecquerellibrary for peak fits. In this work we have generalized thespectre-mlsoftware to abstract out the dependence onbecquereland enable arbitrary user- defined spectrum analyses, in particular those based onGEM. ThepyGEM[11] code is a Python interface to the General Enrichment Measurements (GEM) code [6] used by the IAEA for uranium enrichment NDA. It fits measured spectra in the ∼120–270keV ROI using a set of known U-235 emission lines, forward scatter, and high-energy downscatter profiles, and has recently been updated to handle the asymmetric peak shapes of CZT. In contrast to our Doniach fitbecquerel workflow,pyGEMuses a triple-Gaussian model for each peakarXiv:2509.18517v1 [physics.ins-det] 23 Sep 2025 2 in CZT—one primary peak, one low-energy tail, and one high- energy tail. The user providespyGEMa spectrum from a sample of known U-235 enrichment, and it will then compute a linear calibration between the fit net count rate in the 185.7keV peak and the U-235 atom abundance that can be used to compute the enrichment from an unknown sample spectrum. It is also possible to incorporate correction factors for certain changes between the calibration and sample spectra such as changes in the sample matrix (e.g., U metal vs. U 3O8), Al and steel wall thicknesses, etc. To integrate the two codes, somespectre-ml updates were required to handle both thebecquerel andpyGEMworkflows. As shown in the pseudocode in the Appendix,spectre-mlnow provides the abstract base classesSpectrumAnalyzerand RankingMetric. The user must provide concrete subclasses implementingSpectrumAnalyzer.analyze andRankingMetric.calc, where the latter method takes a spectrum analyzed (e.g., fit) by the former and extracts a singlefloatmetric such as the relative uncertainty in a fit parameter (becquerel) or in an enrichment (pyGEM) calculation. The usualspectre-mlanalysis then proceeds and the various voxel selections tested are then ranked by these metric values, with the best metric value indicating which voxel selection to use for the given application defined by the input spectra and choice of spectrum analysis and ranking metric. We note that nopyGEMcode changes",

We note that nopyGEMcode changes were required, indicating thatspectre-mlend-users can relatively easily slot in their own analysis routines. B. Uranium enrichment assay optimization Multiple U 3O8standards measurements were performed with six US National Laboratory M400 detectors (Brookhaven, Idaho, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Pacific Northwest, and Sandia National Laboratories) [12] and provided to Lawrence Berke- ley National Laboratory for analysis withspectre-ml. In this work we use the30-minute collimated M400 mea- surements of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 969 [13] samples with label U-235 enrichments of1.94wt% and 4.46wt% (certified values of(1.9420±0.0014)wt% and (4.4623±0.0032)wt%). The latter is used as the known- enrichment sample for thepyGEMactivity calibration while the former is used as the unknown sample to be assayed. The relative uncertainty in the U-235 enrichment is a crucial performance metric for U-235 NDA as it is directly used in computing theoperator-inspector difference(OID) in terms ofz-scores or “sigmas”, and used to compare uncertainties against the International Target Values (ITVs) for the GEM- based verification method [14]. A lower relative uncertainty on the measured U-235 enrichment increases the statistical power of the measurement to detect diversions from declared enrichments and thus potential treaty violations. Since the statistical component of the relative uncertainty decreases with the square root of measurement time, long measurement times may be required for high statistics; longer measurement times are however not always an option for inspectors performing verifications in the field. Optimizing for lower relative uncer-tainty can therefore improve the time-efficiency of IAEA NDA tasks. In the optimization examples of Section III, the spectre-mloptimization considers four different classes of algorithms for selecting voxel cluster combinations: machine learning (ML), heuristic, greedy, and random voxel selections. The ML parameter sweeps consist ofn clus= 2–6clusters (Gaussian Mixture only),n comp = 2–6NMF components, andα W= 0.0(i.e., no NMF regularization). The heuristic algorithms are the equal-depth and edge-and-anode algorithms introduced in Ref. [5], withn clus= 2–6andn anode = 15, nedge = 1, respectively. The greedy detector algorithm is used, but not the greedy pixel, depth bin, or voxel algorithms due to memory constraints, and a single sample is run for each of the random pixel, depth bin, and voxel clusterers with nclus= 2–6. III. RESULTS Fig. 1 shows the results of thespectre-ml+pyGEM U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty optimization using the PNNL M400 uranium standards dataset. The enrichment relative uncertainty of1.06%from the bulk (unoptimized) spectrum is improved to0.93%(a relative improvement of 12%) when usingn comp = 3and retaining1out of3Gaussian Mixture clusters. This voxel mask reduces the185.7keV net peak area from8.22×105cps to4.45×105cps (an efficiency reduction to54%of the unoptimized detector) and slightly degrades the peak full width at half maximum (FWHM) from 1.18%to1.20%, but improves the overall fit quality from 2.70to1.93. The top5masks achieve similar final metrics of 0.93%–0.94%. Several of the clustering algorithms (notably the edge-and-anode) clusterer never achieve results better than the bulk value of1.06%.

Similar or betterspectre-ml+pyGEMimprovements in the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty are observed across all six M400 detectors tested—see Table I. The metric relative improvements range from12%to26%, with a mean of20%. Five out of six detectors are best improved by a GaussianMixture clusterer with2out of3clusters retained, while the PNNL detector removes one additional cluster and the BNL detector sees best results from the random depth bin clusterer—see the best cluster masks in Fig. 2. The relative efficiencies after voxel cluster removal range from 54%(PNNL) to70%(BNL), with the remaining four detectors more tightly grouped between61%and68%. All optimizations produce very small FWHM degradations, on average changing from1.15%(bulk) to1.21%(best), for reasons that are not yet known. Finally, thepyGEMfit quality improves in all six optimizations, from an average of2.81to1.71. The analyses above were run with the full30-minute dwell time datasets, where systematic fit uncertainty is expected to dominate over statistical counting uncertainty. To expand this analysis, we also test the performance of these long-dwell- computed masks on shorter sub-samples of the same data. Fig. 3 shows the U-235 enrichment (wt%) and its relative uncertainty (the direct optimization metric) as a function of dwell timetfor three of the six detectors. As expected, the 3 Fig. 1.

As shown in Table II, these crossover times range from17s to117s, with an average of49s, depending on the detector. Similarly, we can quantify thespeedup factor,f t, that could be achieved by dwelling with the optimized model only until the relative uncertainty from the bulk dataset at timetis reached. For the full30-minute datasets, these speedupsf 30 range from5.2×to15.4×, with an average of10.3×, and are also given in Table II. For a shorter5-minute dwell time, the speedupsf 5range from2.3×to5.2×, with an average of3.8×, indicating that the optimized models can achieve the same relative uncertainty as a5-minute bulk measurement in about a quarter of the time. In addition to the improvement in the relative uncertainties in Fig. 3—the precisions of the enrichment calculations—it is also important to discuss the effects on the accuracies.detector crossover timet∗[s] speedup factorf 30 f5 BNL 23 8.9 3.0 INL 39 11.7 5.2 LANL 68 8.9 3.0 ORNL 30 11.7 3.9 PNNL 117 5.2 2.3 SNL 17 15.4 5.2 mean 49 10.3 3.8 TABLE II SUMMARY OF TIME EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS The INL, SNL, and LANL detector datasets in Fig. 3 were specifically chosen to highlight three different cases: the bulk detector accuracy is essentially unchanged by the optimization (INL); it is slightly improved by the optimization (SNL); and it is slightly degraded by the optimization (LANL). Similarly, Fig. 4 summarizes the U-235 enrichment assay results for all six detectors. The LANL M400 result appears to be an outlier that pulls the six-detector mean above the sample’s declared enrichment band, but other than the LANL detector, each de- tector result agrees within error bars. Three of the six detectors have computed U-235 enrichments closer to the declared value without using thespectre-mloptimization, and three of 5 Fig. 3.

DISCUSSION The results of Section III retain a handful of limitations and present opportunities for future work. First, thespectre-ml parameter sweeps are much smaller than those used in Ref. [5], using only2–6clusters and NMF components, only the Gaussian Mixture clusterer (among the ML options), and no NMF regularization. It is likely that the observed20%average relative improvement in the U-235 enrichment relative uncer- tainty metric would improve if the parameter sweeps were expanded. Currently, we are compute-limited by the worse performance of the underlyingscikit-learnlibraries on the Windows",

It is likely that the observed20%average relative improvement in the U-235 enrichment relative uncer- tainty metric would improve if the parameter sweeps were expanded. Currently, we are compute-limited by the worse performance of the underlyingscikit-learnlibraries on the Windows machine required for thepyGEMcode, with even these smaller parameter sweeps taking>1hr wall time on a 4-core 11thGen Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor. Performance is also degraded by the need to run both NMF and fitting routines on spectra ofO(1000)bins for the entire U-235 region rather than theO(100)bins for a single photopeak. Better parallelization, either in thescikit-learnroutines or over individual parameter combinations, could greatly improve the speed of the optimization. We also note that the observed20%average relative im- provement is smaller than the∼3×improvement observed in the U-235 peak analysis of Ref. [5], as expected, due to the much lower systematic fit error arising from the more complex spectrum fit (which includes the195keV peak) inpyGEM. This re-emphasizes the importance of carefully defining the performance metric to be used to avoid specification gaming. The similarity of four out of six best voxel removal models in Table I and therefore masks in Fig. 2 suggests that a single common mask could be applied to improve many M400 detectors without having to specifically optimize each detector, even despite inter-detector performance differences. It would be valuable in the future to quantify this level of mask transferability among detectors. Our analysis here has been limited to using the4.46%- enriched U-235 standard as a calibration standard for assayingthe1.94%-enriched sample. In the future, it could be interest- ing to repeat the analysis for the reverse combination, and to include the20.11%-enriched measurements from the same collection of datasets. Similarly, other safeguards measurement scenarios such as UF 6cylinders could be considered. Finally, we note that the ease with whichpyGEMwas integrated withspectre-mlbodes extremely well for future integrations of other analysis codes. For instance,FRAM[15] could be integrated to test the ability ofspectre-mlto improve the challenging analysis of multiple densely-packed photopeaks in Pu spectra. V. CONCLUSIONS We have integrated thepyGEMuranium enrichment anal- ysis code with thespectre-mlspectroscopic optimization framework, and shown that the uranium enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. Thisspectre-ml+GEMworkflow provides a20%relative improvement (averaged over six H3D M400 detectors) in the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty in30-minute long measurements, and retains similar enrichment accuracy to the unoptimizedpyGEM-only results. These reductions in enrichment relative uncertainty can lead to significant time savings, with the optimized results achieving the same overall relative uncertainty as the unoptimized30-minute measure- ments around10×faster.
