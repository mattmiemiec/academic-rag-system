    "M¨ obius-topological auxiliary function for felectrons Biaoyan Hu1, 2,∗ 1Quantum Science Center of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Shenzhen 518045, China 2Department of Physics, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China f-electron systems exhibit a subtle interplay between strong spin–orbit coupling and crystal- field effects, producing complex energy landscapes that are somewhat cumbersome to compute. We introduce auxiliary functions, constructed by extending hydrogen-like wave functions through a modification of the Legendre function. These functions often possess a M¨ obius-like topology, satisfying ψ(φ) =−ψ(φ+2π), while their squared modulus respects inversion symmetry. By aligning |ψ|2with the symmetry of the crystal field, they allow rapid determination of eigenstate structures without the need for elaborate calculations. The agreement with established results indicates that these functions capture the essential physics while offering considerable computational simplification. Introduction.— Understanding electronic eigenstates in solids is essential for interpreting their magnetic, spec- troscopic, and thermodynamic properties. An early quantum–mechanical treatment of atomic term splitting in crystals was provided by Bethe [1], who analyzed how crystalline electric fields lift electronic degeneracies. This laid the foundation for crystal field theory developed by Van Vleck [2], providing a general framework applied to magnetic and spectroscopic phenomena. Since then, crystal field theory has guided the interpretation of spec- tra and thermodynamic behavior in minerals with transi- tion metals [3], and clarified structure-property relations in luminescent materials [4]. More recently, crystal-field analysis has become a key tool for probing rare-earth magnetism and correlated f-electron systems [5–11]. Formal links between quantum operators and classi- cal multipoles have been established [12]. In particular, the crystal-field Hamiltonian can be expressed via the Stevens operator method [13] as HCF=P l,mBm lOm l, where Bm landOm lare the crystal-field parameters and Stevens operators, respectively [14]. Existing methods for f-electron systems are fully capa- ble but often cumbersome due to proliferating notations and intricate derivations. A more direct approach yield- ing explicit eigenstate structures would greatly simplify analysis of these technically demanding systems. Auxiliary function.— Motivated by the need for a sim- pler approach, we introduce a modified theoretical frame- work based on the hydrogen-like Schr¨ odinger equation. By modifying the Legendre function, we construct func- tions for all angular momenta, including half-integer val- ues, enabling direct determination of f-electron eigen- state structures. The Schr¨ odinger equation for an electron under Coulomb potential in Gaussian units is given by: \u0012 −ℏ2 2me∇2−Ze2 r\u0013 ψ(r, θ, φ ) =Eψ(r, θ, φ ),(1) where meis the electron mass and ∇2is the Laplacian operator. This equation is generally applicable only to hydrogen-like atoms, but with Slater’s rules [15], it can beapproximately applied to multi-electron systems. How- ever, for felectrons with strong spin–orbit coupling, the equation cannot yield correct wave functions. In this work, fully aware of its limitations, we nonetheless apply it to felectrons. The solution of Eq. 1 can be expressed as follows: ψ(r, θ, φ ) =R(r)Ym l(θ, φ)∝R(r)Pm l(cosθ)eimφ, where Ym l(θ, φ) are spherical harmonics constructed from the associated Legendre polynomials Pm l(cosθ). Here, l andmdenote the degree and order of Pm l, corresponding to the orbital angular momentum",

The solution of Eq. 1 can be expressed as follows: ψ(r, θ, φ ) =R(r)Ym l(θ, φ)∝R(r)Pm l(cosθ)eimφ, where Ym l(θ, φ) are spherical harmonics constructed from the associated Legendre polynomials Pm l(cosθ). Here, l andmdenote the degree and order of Pm l, corresponding to the orbital angular momentum and its z-component. Throughout this paper, unless otherwise stated, l∈N andm∈Zsatisfy −l≤m≤l. Thefelectrons experience strong spin–orbit coupling, with total angular momentum given by J=L+S. Con- sequently, the solutions of Eq. 1 should be expressed in terms of the total angular momentum Jand its projec- tion along the z-axis, M. This leads to a new function: ψ(r, θ, φ )≡R(r)YM J(θ, φ) ≡R(r)s (2J+ 1)( J−M)! 4π(J+M)!PM J(cosθ)eiMφ, (2) where 2 J∈NandM∈ {− J,−J+ 1, . . . , J }; the same conventions apply throughout. Here, the factorial is de- fined by x!≡Γ(x+ 1), and this convention is used con- sistently below. We refer to the function in Eq. 2 as the auxiliary function . The auxiliary function is not the true wave function of anfelectron, but a simplified form that captures many essential features of the actual wave function. Both share the same symmetries, and the integrals of their squared moduli are equal to one. The difference lies in continu- ity. While the wave function and its squared modulus are continuous, the auxiliary function becomes discon- tinuous when Jis a half-integer. For superposed states, the auxiliary function’s squared modulus is sometimes discontinuous on the equatorial plane. Despite this, the auxiliary function is useful, as it circumvents the oftenarXiv:2509.00889v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 31 Aug 2025 2 cumbersome computation and allows one, through rela- tively simple analysis, to directly obtain the eigenstate structures of felectrons under a crystal field. The squared modulus of the auxiliary function is re- ferred to as the auxiliary density . For felectrons, its symmetry matches that of the crystal field, allowing one to infer the eigenstate structures directly from the crystal field symmetry. ThePM Jin Eq. 2 is an extension of Pm l, and there ex- ist multiple ways to generalize Pm l. Legendre functions with non-integer degrees and orders have been discussed extensively [16–31]. The most widely used form involves hypergeometric functions [17–28] and was initially intro- duced by Hobson [20], though this origin is often over- looked. Some works explicitly refer to these as Hobson’s associated Legendre functions [22]. For convenience, this paper refers to them as Hobson’s Legendre functions . For half-integer degrees and orders (as opposed to ar- bitrary fractional values), the generalized Rodrigues for- mula (Supplemental Material (SM) Eq. S21) can be used to compute PM J(x) [16]. Since J+Mis a natural number, the derivative of order J+Mis well defined. We find that this procedure yields results identical to Hobson’s Legendre functions, and thus we treat them as belonging to the same class, without discussing them separately. Hunter et al. proposed an alternative solution [29, 30], identifying regularities of factors for integer orders and degrees and generalizing them to half-integer cases. The resulting expressions satisfy the associated Legendre equation, and a table of factors was",
    "treat them as belonging to the same class, without discussing them separately. Hunter et al. proposed an alternative solution [29, 30], identifying regularities of factors for integer orders and degrees and generalizing them to half-integer cases. The resulting expressions satisfy the associated Legendre equation, and a table of factors was provided. We re- fer to these as Hunter’s Legendre functions . Although tables are inherently limited, once such pat- terns are established, a general formula can, in princi-ple, be written and extended to arbitrary parameters. Closed-form expressions of this kind have been presented previously [31–33], with Bildstein in particular general- izing the associated Legendre polynomials to half-integer degrees and orders [31]. Both approaches ultimately lead to the same system, differing only in coefficients. We therefore treat Bildstein’s results as equivalent to those of Hunter et al. . Current Legendre functions can be broadly classified into two types: Hobson’s and Hunter’s, both of which satisfy the associated Legendre equation. To construct a useful auxiliary function that resembles a wave function, the Legendre function must not only satisfy the asso- ciated Legendre equation but also three additional key properties. Initially, it should be square-integrable, al- lowing normalization. Next, functions of opposite orders should exhibit similarity, so that auxiliary densities cor- responding to opposite angular momenta share the same overall shape. Finally, Legendre functions’ parity must match that of J+M. This guarantees that the auxil- iary density of the superposed states preserves inversion symmetry, a feature central to our work. Associated Legendre polynomials of integer degree and order elegantly satisfy all these properties. However, for half-integer degrees and orders, the properties become mutually exclusive to some extent. As shown in Tab. I, neither Hobson’s nor Hunter’s Legendre functions can si- multaneously satisfy all these requirements. Our analysis shows that introducing the sign function sgn( x) resolves this conflict. The Legendre function in this work is defined from Hobson’s Legendre function as follows: PM J(x)this work ≡(−1)(M+|M|)[1 2+2J+Jsgn(x)](J+M)! (J− |M|)!P−|M| J(x)Hobson (3) = (−1)(M+|M|)[1 2+2J+Jsgn(x)](J+M)! (J+|M|)!(1−x2)|M| 2 2J⌊J−|M| 2⌋X k=0(−1)k k!(2J−2k)! (J−k)!xJ−|M|−2k (J− |M| −2k)!.(4) An example is shown in Fig. 1. For J= 5/2 and M= 3/2, neither Hobson’s nor Hunter’s Legendre func- tions satisfy all four properties. In contrast, our function avoids the divergence present in Hobson’s form while pre- serving the correct parity that Hunter’s function lacks. Although it is singular at x= 0, this feature is necessary to satisfy all core requirements. When JandMare half-integers, the wave function ψ∝PM J(cosθ)eiMφbecomes antiperiodic in φ, satisfy- ingψ(r, θ, φ ) =−ψ(r, θ, φ + 2π) and thereby exhibiting a M¨ obius-type topology, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Tomaintain single-valuedness, continuity of the auxiliary function with respect to φmust be relinquished. For instance, if φis defined on [0 ,2π), the auxiliary function is necessarily discontinuous at φ= 0. Nevertheless, the density |ψ|2remains fully periodic and continuous in φ. Hunter et al. similarly mentioned the M¨ obius band when discussing half-integer spherical harmonics [29], as it arises from the eiMφterm for half-integer M.

An auxiliary density consistent with the local symmetry is constructed, allowing the eigenstate structures to be determined without exhaustive diago- nalization. Predictions based on this framework show excellent agreement with full numerical solutions, offer- ing both computational efficiency and insight into the electronic structure of strongly correlated felectrons. Symmetry analysis.— Auxiliary functions can be em- ployed to determine energy eigenstates, provided their densities conform to the crystal-field symmetry. The eigenstate structure is dictated by rotational symmetry together with a horizontal mirror plane, while vertical mirror planes constrain the phases of the complex coeffi- cients forming the eigenstate components. FIG. 2. (a) The factor eiφ/2is plotted along a circular arc of radius 3, with its vector trajectory forming a M¨ obius strip. (b) Auxiliary densities distribution of f-electron states in Nd3+(J= 9/2). Kets |M⟩denote the quantum states. The auxiliary densities exhibit O(2) symmetry, and the surface encloses 50% of the total density. The auxiliary density of a pure eigenstate with a single Mexhibits continuous O(2) rotational symmetry. A su- perposition, however, generally breaks this symmetry, re- ducing it to discrete rotational symmetries. For instance, for a two-state superposition |ψ⟩=C1|M1⟩+C2|M2⟩, the auxiliary density is: |ψ|2=|C1|M1⟩+C2|M2⟩|2 = A(r, θ)eiM1φ+B(r, θ)eiM2φ 2 =\u0000 AeiM1φ+BeiM2φ\u0001\u0000 A∗e−iM1φ+B∗e−iM2φ\u0001 =|A|2+|B|2+ 2|AB|cos [(M1−M2)φ+ arg( AB∗)], where AandBare independent of φ. The auxiliary density thus has |M1−M2|-fold rotational symmetry. For example, |M1−M2|= 3 gives threefold symmetry; = 2, twofold; = 1, no rotational symmetry. For a general superposition of Nstates that |ψ⟩=PN j=1Aj(r, θ)eiMjφ, the auxiliary density is: |ψ|2= NX j=1Aj(r, θ)eiMjφ 2 =NX j=1|Aj|2+X j̸=k|AjAk|cos [(Mj−Mk)φ+ Arg( AjA∗ k)]. (5) Therefore, the auxiliary density exhibits κ-fold rotational symmetry if and only if the following condition hold: κ= gcd( Mj−Mk), (6) 4 where gcd (greatest common divisor) is taken over all",
    "|ψ⟩=PN j=1Aj(r, θ)eiMjφ, the auxiliary density is: |ψ|2= NX j=1Aj(r, θ)eiMjφ 2 =NX j=1|Aj|2+X j̸=k|AjAk|cos [(Mj−Mk)φ+ Arg( AjA∗ k)]. (5) Therefore, the auxiliary density exhibits κ-fold rotational symmetry if and only if the following condition hold: κ= gcd( Mj−Mk), (6) 4 where gcd (greatest common divisor) is taken over all pairs ( j, k). The corresponding eigenstate, with |ψ|2ex- hibiting κ-fold rotational symmetry, takes the form: |ψ⟩=⌊2J−q κ⌋X j=0Cj|J−κj−q⟩, q∈ {0,1,···, κ−1}. (7) The auxiliary density is always inversion-symmetric (see proof in SM). When combined with even-fold ro- tational symmetry, it automatically exhibits horizontal mirror symmetry. For odd-fold rotational symmetry that possesses inherent inversion symmetry, an introduction of a horizontal mirror plane will double the rotational symmetry, effectively making it even-fold. In this sense, horizontal mirror symmetry amplifies odd-fold rotations while leaving even-fold rotations unchanged. Depending onκ, this enhancement changes the symmetry from C κ to either C 2κmor C κmas: I + C κ=( S2κ+σz− − − → C2κm,ifκis odd , Cκm+σz− − − → Cκm,ifκis even .(8) Rotational and horizontal mirror symmetries constrain the composition of an eigenstate but not its absolute ori- entation in φ, which is fixed by vertical mirror symmetry. From Eq. 5, the phase differences Arg( AjA∗ k) determine the azimuthal positions of the density maxima. For a two-component state |ψ⟩=C1|M1⟩+C2|M2⟩, vertical mirror symmetry at φ=φmimposes: tan ArgC2 C1= tan[( M1−M2)φm], (9) where the tangent removes the ambiguity of a global phase. While the extension to multi-component states is more involved, this relation illustrates how auxiliary functions accommodate vertical mirror symmetry. The above laws regarding the eigenstates can also be obtained using the crystal field Hamiltonian in Stevens- operator form. However, the auxiliary function provides a simpler and conceptually novel perspective. Example.— We consider the optically active material NdCl 3[34] as an example. The Nd3+ion (J= 9/2) expe- riences a crystal field generated by the nine surrounding Cl−ions. First, this environment exhibits a threefold ro- tational symmetry, yielding gcd( Mj−Mk) = 3. Second, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane leads to I+C 3= S6+σz− − − → C6, so that the auxiliary function acquires six- fold rotational symmetry with gcd( Mj−Mk) = 6. As a result, the eigenstates take the forms: C±9 2|±9 2⟩+C∓3 2|∓3 2⟩, C±7 2|±7 2⟩+C∓5 2|∓5 2⟩,|±1 2⟩. Third, taking into account the vertical mirror plane at φm=−6.72◦, Eq. 9 gives: tan Arg\u0010 C±9 2/C∓3 2\u0011 = tan Arg\u0010 C±7 2/C∓5 2\u0011 ≈ ±0.849.These relations, derived from the auxiliary functions, are confirmed by McPhase simulations [35], which pro- duce eigenstates consistent with the forms above. The extracted phase ratios, tan Arg\u0010 C±9 2/C∓3 2\u0011 ≈tan Arg\u0010 C±7 2/C∓5 2\u0011 ≈ ±0.824, show excellent agreement with the predicted values. The auxiliary densities fully preserve the crystal-field symme- try, further validating the method. See Supplementary Materials for details. Discussion.— In the presence of degeneracy, certain eigenstates may appear to deviate from the predicted pattern of the auxiliary functions, as they can form linear combinations within the degenerate subspace.

    "See Supplementary Materials for details. Discussion.— In the presence of degeneracy, certain eigenstates may appear to deviate from the predicted pattern of the auxiliary functions, as they can form linear combinations within the degenerate subspace. A suitable basis transformation restores the expected form, as illus- trated in NdCl 3, where the degenerate ±1 2 states may combine into1√ 2( +1 2 + −1 2 ), but agreement with the rules is recovered in the proper basis. The factor sgn( x) ensures the correct parity of half- integer Mstates and preserves inversion symmetry in the auxiliary density. Its use, however, sometimes leads to discontinuities at the equatorial plane ( θ= 90◦) for superpositions with odd rotational symmetry, as in the state1√ 2( +1 2 + −1 2 ). The specific form of sgn( x) is not unique; any factor that enforces the correct parity for positive half-integer Msuffices. The expression\u00021 2+ 2J+J,sgn(x)\u0003 in Eqs. (3) and (4) could be reduced to\u00021 2+ sgn( x)\u0003 , but we retain the original form to ensure that the Legendre function’s sign near x= 0 matches Hobson’s. Since spin Sand orbital angular momentum Lare ne- glected, the auxiliary functions provide only approximate descriptions of f-electron wave functions. It does not ap- ply to cases such as Gd3+, where L= 0 and the ion forms singlets despite the theory predicting multi-component states. Nevertheless, the auxiliary functions offer a practical tool: small discontinuities or deviations in degenerate systems do not diminish its utility for symmetry analysis and qualitative characterization of eigenstate structures. Conclusion and Outlook.— By extending Legendre functions to half-integer degrees and orders, we construct auxiliary functions with M¨ obius-like topologies. These functions provide an efficient framework for predicting eigenstates in f-electron systems. They naturally re- spect crystal-field symmetries, including multi-fold rota- tional and mirror symmetries, and offer an intuitive ap- proach for determining eigenstate configurations. Com- pared with full crystal-field calculations, the auxiliary functions reproduce eigenstate structures with high ac- curacy, demonstrating their practical value for analyzing complex f-electron materials. The predictive success of these auxiliary functions sug- gests they capture essential physical principles underly- ingf-electron eigenstates. While their full physical sig- 5 nificance remains to be elucidated, this approach opens promising avenues for further exploration, including ap- plications to other strongly correlated or geometrically frustrated systems, investigations of deeper connections with symmetry and topology, and interpretation of ex- perimental observations in complex materials.

S2 is set to 3 for the angular momentum of felectrons. Whether lshould instead be J,L, orSfrom spin–orbit coupling remains unclear. Laguerre functions can be expressed via hypergeometric functions, but may diverge for half-integer parameters. As our analysis is insensitive to the radial distribution, we temporarily adopt l= 3. Since the physical meaning of the auxiliary function is not fully established, the validity of this choice requires further investigation. EXAMPLE OF NdCl 3 As stated in the text, taking NdCl 3as an example. The total angular momentum of Nd3+isJ= 9/2. To analyze its symmetry, we first consider rotational symmetry. The nine nearest-neighbor Cl−ions surrounding Nd3+generate a crystal field with threefold rotational symmetry. Substituting J= 9/2 and κ= 3 into Eq. 7, we obtain: |ψ⟩=( C9 2 9 2 +C3 2 3 2 +C−3 2 −3 2 +C−9 2 −9 2 C±7 2 ±7 2 +C±1 2 ±1 2 +C∓5 2 ∓5 2 . (S5) Second, we examine horizontal mirror symmetry to further characterize the system. The nine nearest-neighbor Cl− ions exhibit horizontal mirror symmetry. According to Eq. 8, since κ= 3 is odd, we have I + C 3= S 6+σz− − − → C6m. Imposing horizontal mirror symmetry transforms S 6into C 6m. Consequently, the true eigenstates of NdCl 3form a subset of Eq. S5, adopting sixfold symmetry as follows: |ψ⟩=  C±9 2 ±9 2 +C∓3 2 ∓3 2 C±7 2 ±7 2 +C∓5 2 ∓5 2 ±1 2 . (S6) 7 FIG. S1. The ionic structure of NdCl 3. One of the vertical mirror is located at φm=−6.72◦. FIG. S2. Auxiliary densities of the eigenstates of NdCl 3. They all satisfy the symmetries of the crystal field. The surface represents the equiprobability density surface that encloses 50% of the total auxiliary density. For| ±1 2⟩, the difference in Mwith any other state is less than 6, with the maximum being 5. To realize sixfold rotational symmetry, | ±1 2⟩must therefore remain isolated as a distinct state. Third, we analyze the vertical mirror symmetry. As shown in Fig. S1, one of the vertical mirror planes of NdCl 3is located at φm=−6.72◦. Using Eq. 9 and Eq. S6, we obtain: tan ArgC±9 2 C∓3 2= tan ArgC±7 2 C∓5 2=∓tan(6 φm)≈ ±0.849 . (S7) Using the auxiliary function, the results of Eq. S6 and Eq. S7 can be derived through straightforward analysis. These results are further validated by McPhase, a software package for computing static and dynamic magnetic properties of rare-earth compounds, including phase diagrams and excitations",
    "2 C∓5 2=∓tan(6 φm)≈ ±0.849 . (S7) Using the auxiliary function, the results of Eq. S6 and Eq. S7 can be derived through straightforward analysis. These results are further validated by McPhase, a software package for computing static and dynamic magnetic properties of rare-earth compounds, including phase diagrams and excitations [35]. With McPhase, the precise ground and excited states of NdCl 3can be obtained as follows:   |ψ0⟩±= 0.9989 ±9 2 + (0.0359∓0.0296i) ∓3 2 |ψ1⟩±= 0.9909 ±7 2 + (0.1037∓0.0855i) ∓5 2 |ψ2⟩±= (−0.1037∓0.0855i) ±7 2 + 0.9909 ∓5 2 |ψ3⟩±= (−0.0359∓0.0296i) ±9 2 + 0.9989 ∓3 2 |ψ4⟩±= ±1 2 . (S8) It can be seen that all the eigenstates conform to Eq. S6, which verifies the validity of the result obtained by auxiliary function. The coefficients in Eq. S8 can be calculated as follows: tan ArgC±9 2 C∓3 2= tan ArgC±7 2 C∓5 2≈ ±0.824 . (S9) 8 A comparison between Eq. S7 and Eq. S9 shows that the prediction in Eq. S7 is highly accurate, exhibiting only a very small discrepancy from Eq. S9, likely due to the approximations in the McPhase calculation. We have plotted the auxiliary density distribution corresponding to the intrinsic states of NdCl 3, as shown in Fig. S2. It is evident that the distribution perfectly conforms to the symmetry inherent in the crystal field. ABOUT LEGENDRE FUNCTIONS 4 important properties In this work, we need to find or construct a Legendre function PM J(x) that satisfies the following four properties: \u0014 (1−x2)d2 dx2−2xd dx+J(J+ 1)−M2 1−x2\u0015 PM J(x) = 0 , (S10) Z1 0|PM J(x)|2dx=1 2J+ 1(J+M)! (J−M)!, (S11) P−M J(x) (J−M)! = PM J(x) (J+M)! , (S12) PM J(x) = (−1)J+MPM J(−x). (S13) These four properties hold for associated Legendre polynomials with integer degree and order. For half-integer degrees, constructing the corresponding functions requires additional care. Properties (S10–S13) correspond one-to- one to those listed in Table I, with the second and third properties in the table weaker than those in Eqs. S11 and S12 to accommodate Hunter’s alternative normalization convention. Eq. S10–S13 each have specific implications for the spherical harmonics YM J(θ, φ) =q (2J+1)(J−M)! 4π(J+M)!PM J(cosθ)eiMφ. Equation S10 ensures that YM J(θ, φ) is an eigenfunction of ˆL2with eigenvalue J(J+1)ℏ2and of ˆLzwith eigenvalue Mℏ, namely: ˆL2YM J(θ, φ) =−ℏ2\u00121 sinθ∂ ∂θsinθ∂ ∂θ+1 sin2θ∂2 ∂φ2\u0013 YM J(θ, φ) =J(J+ 1)ℏ2YM J(θ, φ), (S14) ˆLzYM J(θ, φ) =ℏ i∂ ∂φYM J(θ, φ) =MℏYM J(θ, φ). (S15) Equation S11 ensures that YM Jsatisfies the normalization condition, namely: Z2π 0Zπ 0|YM J(θ, φ)|2sinθdθdφ = 1. (S16) Equation S12 ensures that the auxiliary density distributions of |−M⟩and|+M⟩are identical, namely: ψ−M J(θ, φ) 2 ψM J(θ, φ) 2= Y−M J(θ, φ) 2 YM J(θ, φ) 2= 1. (S17) Equation S13 ensures that the auxiliary density of any superposition state exhibits inversion symmetry, namely: |ψ(θ, φ)|2=|ψ(π−θ, φ+π)|2.

Two important approaches exist for extending the associated Legendre polynomials to non-integer orders and degrees.

Among these, Pµ λ(z) serves as the natural extension of the Legendre polynomial, with its explicit form given by [20–28]: Pµ λ(z) =1 (−µ)!\u0012z+ 1 z−1\u0013µ/2 2F1\u0012 −λ, λ+ 1; 1 −µ;1−z 2\u0013 , (S19) where λ,µ, and zmay be complex, and 2F1denotes the hypergeometric function. When λandµare integers or half-integers JandM, the standard Legendre function PM J(x) can be expressed as follows: PM J(x) =(J+M)! (J−M)!(1−x2)−M/2 2J⌊(J+M)/2⌋X k=0(−1)k k!(2J−2k)! (J−k)!xJ+M−2k (J+M−2k)!. (S20) This result can also be derived from the generalized Rodrigues formula of the associated Legendre function, as follows: PM J(x) =(−1)M 2JJ!(1−x2)M/2dJ+M dxJ+M\u0000 x2−1\u0001J. (S21) These results agree with those given in Eqs. S19 and S20. Table S1 presents specific forms of Hobson’s PM J(x). The associated Legendre polynomials arise as the special case of Eq. S19 with λ∈Nandµ∈[−λ, λ]∩Z. In this case, the prefactor ( −λ) in Eq. S19 forces all terms with indices greater than λto vanish, truncating the infinite series to a finite sum. Consequently, the Legendre function reduces to polynomials. Hobson’s Legendre functions satisfy Eq. S10 and Eq. S13, but for half-integer degrees and orders they do not satisfy Eq. S12. For half-integer orders M < 1, Eq. S11 remains valid; for half-integer orders M > 1, however, Eq. S11 breaks down and the integral diverges. Hence, no normalization coefficient can be defined, and the functions are intrinsically non-normalizable. Since Hobson’s Legendre functions fail to satisfy Eq. S11 and Eq. S12, they are not suitable for the present work. Hunter’s Legendre function Hunter et al. proposed an alternative formulation of Legendre function",

S11 and Eq. S12, they are not suitable for the present work. Hunter’s Legendre function Hunter et al. proposed an alternative formulation of Legendre function parameters, valid when both the degree and the order are integers or half-integers [29, 30]. By carefully examining the associated Legendre polynomials, patterns 10 TABLE S2. Hunter’s PM J(x): In Hunter’s convention, PM J(x) may be taken as P|M| J(x) for M < 0.

Hunter also provided a table of these factors [29], from which Table S2 lists expressions of several Hunter’s Legendre functions. Hunter’s results are expressed entirely as polynomials and are valid only when both the degree and the order are integers or half-integers, and they do not extend to general fractional parameters. Strictly speaking, these should be called Hunter’s Legendre polynomials, but for simplicity we refer to them here as Hunter’s Legendre functions. Hunter provided expressions for PM Jonly for M≥0, since M < 0 is unnecessary: according to Hunter’s convention, the spherical harmonics are defined as YM J≡P|M| J(cosθ)eiMφ[30], making P−|M| J redundant. Equivalently, one can understand this as defining P−|M| J≡P|M| J. It is under this understanding that the third condition in Table I is marked with a ✓. Furthermore, it is straightforward to verify that the squared modulus of these polynomials is integrable, so the second condition in Table I is also satisfied. Although Hunter’s functions do not strictly satisfy Eqs. S11 and S12, this discrepancy arises only from differences in coefficient definitions; they still satisfy the integrability and symmetry implied by these equations. Hunter correctly identified the underlying patterns, and his functions do satisfy the associated Legendre equation (Eq. S10). Therefore, Hunter’s Legendre functions meet three of the four conditions, but they do not satisfy the fourth condition in Table I (Eq. S13). If the auxiliary function is chosen as Hunter’s Legendre function, the resulting auxiliary density may fail to preserve inversion symmetry in certain cases—specifically, when Jis half-integer and the superposition state includes both M < 0 and M > 0 components. Consequently, Hunter’s approach is also not ideal, and a new formulation of Legendre functions remains necessary. Legendre function in this work None of the existing approaches is fully satisfactory, motivating an alternative design that satisfies all four conditions: Eqs. S10–S13. Hobson’s Legendre functions fail to satisfy Eqs. S11 and S12, while Hunter’s functions do not satisfy Eq. S13. For half-integer JandM, the third and fourth conditions are partially contradictory. For example, with M=±1/2, Eq. S13 requires P1/2 J(x) and P−1/2 J(x) to have opposite parity, whereas Eq. S12 requires",
    "S10–S13. Hobson’s Legendre functions fail to satisfy Eqs. S11 and S12, while Hunter’s functions do not satisfy Eq. S13. For half-integer JandM, the third and fourth conditions are partially contradictory. For example, with M=±1/2, Eq. S13 requires P1/2 J(x) and P−1/2 J(x) to have opposite parity, whereas Eq. S12 requires them to have the same parity. Constructing a Legendre function that satisfies both conditions is therefore nontrivial. This conflict is resolved by introducing the sign function sgn( x), which allows simultaneous satisfaction of all four conditions. Since it is generally impossible to satisfy Eqs. S10–S13 simultaneously, we must sacrifice continuity at x= 0. This is achieved by introducing a sgn( x) factor. The Legendre function in this work is defined as follows: Pµ λ(x)this work ≡(−1)(µ+|µ|)[1 2+2λ+λsgn(x)](λ+µ)! (λ− |µ|)!P−|µ| λ(x)Hobson , (S22) where ν, µ∈Z. For 2 J∈NandM∈ {− J,1−J, . . . , J }, Eq. 4 holds. Table S3 lists some PM J(x) in this work for half-integer JandMatx̸= 0. Introducing sgn( x) changes the parity for positive half-integer M, converting odd functions into even ones and vice versa. This may produce a discontinuity at x= 0 when J−Mis even, but the auxiliary density often remains continuous in non-superposed states or when it possesses even-fold rotational symmetry. As noted in the main text, the choice of the exponent of ( −1) in Eq. S22 is not unique. We adopt [1 2+2λ+λsgn(x)] 11 TABLE S3. PM J(x) in this work for x=±|x|, with x̸= 0.

PROOF OF INVERSION SYMMETRY IN THE AUXILIARY DENSITY The auxiliary density |ψ|2of a superposition is always inversion-symmetric. Equation S13 plays a crucial role in this property. We will use it to prove the inversion symmetry of the auxiliary density in this section. For a single auxiliary function, the auxiliary density is: |ψ(r, θ, φ )|2= A(r)PM J(cosθ)eiMφ 2(S23) For cases in which JandMare both integers or half-integers (as below), with Eq.

(S24) Thus, the inversion symmetry of singlet auxiliary density is proved. Consider the superposition of two states |ψ⟩=|C1|M1⟩+C2|M2⟩, the auxiliary density is: |ψ(r, θ, φ )|2 =|C1|M1⟩+C2|M2⟩|2 = A(r)PM1 J(cosθ)eiM1φ+B(r)PM2 J(cosθ)eiM2φ 2 = APM1 J(cosθ) 2 + BPM2 J(cosθ) 2 + 2 ABPM1 J(cosθ)PM2 J(cosθ) cosn (M1−M2)φ+ Argh APM1 J(cosθ)B∗PM2 J(cosθ)∗io = APM1 J(cosθ) 2 + BPM2 J(cosθ) 2 + 2 ABPM1 J(cosθ)PM2 J(cosθ) cosn (M1−M2)φ+ Arg ( AB∗) + Argh PM1 J(cosθ)PM2 J(cosθ)io .

This completes the proof. It is worth noting that the transition from Eq. S26 to Eq. S27 relies directly on Eq. S13. For superpositions involving more than two states, the proof follows the same reasoning and is omitted here. Strictly speaking, Eq. S13 is not a necessary and sufficient condition. A weaker requirement that still ensures inversion symmetry of a superposition is: PM+1 J(−x) PM+1 J(x)=−PM J(−x) PM J(x). (S29) Hunter’s Legendre functions do not satisfy Eq. S29 for M=−1 2. With these functions, the corresponding density retains inversion symmetry only when all Mvalues in the superposition share the same sign; once both positive and negative Mappear, the symmetry is lost.
