    "ON BOUNDARY PROBLEMS FOR REGULAR FUNCTIONS IN HYPERCOMPLEX ANALYSIS∗ Jinyuan Du1& Pei Dang2 1. Department of Mathematics, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, P. R. China E–mail: jydu@whu.edu.cn 2. Faculty of Innovation Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macao, China E–mail: pdang@must.edu.mo Abstract In this article, the authors survey and review the studies of boundary value problems for regular functions in Clifford analysis, which include theoretical foundations and useful methods. Its theoretical bases consist of the generalized Cauchy theorem, the generalized Cauchy integral formula, the Painlev´ e theorem and boundary behaviors of the Cauchy type integrals, as well as various integral representations. Certain boundary value problems in the Clifford algebra setting and singular integral equations are introduced.

Boundary value problems (BVPs) for analytic functions in the classical complex analysis is an important branch of mathematical analysis [17,29,32], and has been actively studied due to its theoretical elegance and widespread applications in physics and other subjects such as elastic theory, hydromechanics, fracture mechanics, etc. [30,33,41]. It is natural that we hope to develop corresponding theories on boundary value problems for regular functions in the hypercomplex analysis similarly to those for analytic functions in the classical complex analysis. In fact, some results on boundary value problems for analytic functions in the classical complex analysis have been generalized to those for regular functions in Clifford analysis [2–6,8,19, 20,22,25,28,34– 40,43–47,50]. However, to our knowledge, the foundation for boundary problems in Clifford analysis has not been established completely. For example, the generalized Cauchy theorem (i.e., Cauchy-Goursat theorem) and generalized Cauchy integral formula had not been conscientiously treated in Clifford analysis for a long time after the Cauchy theorem and Cauchy integral formula were obtained in Clifford analysis [1,7,12]. The generalized Cauchy theorem and the generalized Cauchy integral formula play crucial roles in the theory of boundary value problems for analytic functions in the classical complex analysis, so do their analogues in Clifford analysis, still called Cauchy-Goursat theorem and the generalized Cauchy integral formula. Due to the necessity of Cauchy-Goursat theorem and the generalized Cauchy integral formula, many studies tacitly assumed their existence. Before they were strictly proved, however, Painlev´ e theorem is lack of rigorous ∗This work is supported by Macao Science and Technology Development Fund, MSAR.

    "theoretical support before these basic theories (e.g., Painlev´ e theorem) are strictly set up. Our aim here is to bring together some dispersed materials, not to give a complete survey. We will point out some major contributions on the basic theory related to boundary value problems for regular functions and the recent results and methods to solve boundary value problems for regular functions. In next section, we introduce some major contributions on boundary behavior of the Cauchy type integral. In§3, we point out the recent development on boundary value problems for regular functions. Then, the jump Riemann boundary value problems for regular functions in Clifford analysis are formulated and some open problems for general Riemann boundary value problems are given in§4. In§5, we discuss some singular integral equations and the inversion formula for Cauchy principal value. In§6, we establish the generalized Sochocki–Plemelj formula and solve the Dirichlet problems by using it. Throughout this paper, all notations and terminologies are referred to [13]. 2 Boundary behavior of Cauchy type integrals LetC(V n) be the Clifford algebra obtained by algebraically spanning the linear subspace (1-vector space) Vn=span{e 1,···, e n}[7,13], of which basis are written as{e A, A=(h 1,···, h r)∈PN,1≤h 1<···< h r≤n}, whereNstands for the set{1,···, n}andPNdenotes the family of all order-preserving subsets ofNin the above fixed way. We assume that Ω+is a bounded open domain inRn+1with aC1-smooth boundary Γ =∂Ω+,that is oriented by the exterior normal, and Ω−=Rn+1\\{Ω+∪Γ}. We agree that the regular (entire) function always names one of the left regular (entire) function and the right regular (entire) function, unless otherwise stated, we often abbreviate “ left regular (entire) function” or “right regular (entire) function” as “ regular (entire) function”. Definition 2.1A functionFis said to be sectionally regular withΓas its jump surface, if it is regular in Ω+andΩ−, and has positive and negative boundary values whenwtends to any pointx∈ΓfromΩ+and Ω−, i.e., there exist F+(x) = lim Ω+∋w→xF(w), F−(x) = lim Ω−∋w→xF(w).(2.1) Remark 2.1It is easy to prove thatF+∈C\u0010 Ω+, C(V n)\u0011 andF−∈C\u0010 Ω−, C(V n)\u0011 . Now we introduce some results related to the jump Riemann boundary value problem. Jump Riemann boundary value problem(jump problem). Find a sectionally regular function Φ, with Γ as its jump surface, satisfying the boundary value condition Φ+(x) = Φ−(x) +g(x), x∈Γ,(2.2) whereg∈H(Γ) (i.e., H¨ older continuous on Γ, seen below in Detail). To find a special solution of the jump problem (2.2), we introduce the Cauchy type integrals with the densityfas follows.\u0010 C[f]\u0011 (w) =1W n+1Z ΓE(x−w) dσf(x), w∈ Rn+1\\Γ (2.3) and\u0010 [f]C\u0011 (w) =1W n+1Z Γf(x) dσ E(x−w), w∈ Rn+1\\Γ,(2.4) whereEis the Cauchy kernel function, given by E(x−w) =x−w |x−w|n+1, x̸=w,(2.5) _ n+1=2π(n+1)/2 Γ((n+ 1)/2)(2.6) 2 is the area of the unit sphere Sn=n x,|x|= 1, x= (x 0, x1,···, x n)∈ Rn+1o ,(2.7) and dσ=nX k=0(−1)kekdbxk=nX k=0(−1)kekdx0∧ ··· ∧dx k−1∧dx k+1∧ ··· ∧dx n.(2.8) Theorem 2.1 (Theorem for the Cauchy type integral[13–15])Iffis absolutely integrable onΓ, then the Cauchy type integralsC[f]and[f]Care, respectively, left and right regular.

Moreover, lim sup |x|→+∞|x|m \u0000 C[f]\u0001 (x) <+∞,lim sup |x|→+∞|x|m \u0000 [f]C\u0001 (x) <+∞,(2.9) in particular, lim |x|→+∞|x|m−1 (C[f])(x) = 0,lim |x|→+∞|x|m−1 ([f]C)(x) = 0.(2.10) Theorem 2.1 is based on the following rule. Theorem 2.2 (Leibniz rule[14,15])Suppose thatΩis an open set inRn+1andϕ∈C(Γ×Ω). Let Φ(w) =Z Γϕ(x, w)dσf(x), w∈Ω,(2.11) ifD[ϕ]∈C(Γ×Ω)),then \u0000 D[Φ]\u0001 (w) =Z Γ\u0000 D[ϕ]\u0001 (x, w)dσf(x), w∈Ω.(2.12) Let Ψ(w) =Z Γf(x)dσψ(x, w), w∈Ω,(2.13) if[ϕ]D∈C(Γ×Ω)),then \u0000 [Ψ]D\u0001 (w) =Z Γf(x)dσ\u0000 [ψ]D\u0001 (x, w), w∈Ω.(2.14) Now we dress slightly up the Cauchy type integral. After that, we will see that it is a copy of the Cauchy type integral in one complex variable. First we introduce a mapping capitaln:x=\u0000 x0, x1,···, x n\u0001 7−→nX i=0xiei=X.(2.15) Obviously, it is a proper isomorphism betweenRn+1and the linear subspace span{e 0, e1, e2,···, e n}ofC(V n), in which the elementsλ=λ 0+λ1e1+···+λ nenwithλ 0,···, λ n∈ Rare called paravectors. In this view, E(x) =|x|1−nX−1,whereX−1is the inverse element ofX.Since there is no multiplication inRn+1,it is not confused thatx−1is treated asX−1. Moreover, ifα, β∈C(V n) and there exists the inverseα−1, we denote α−1β=|β α, βα−1=β α|,(2.16) which are, respectively, called left division and right division. In this way (2.3) and (2.4) may be rewritten as \u0000 C[f]\u0001 (w) =1W n+1Z Γ|dσ f(x) |x−w|n−1(x−w), w∈ Rn+1\\Γ,(2.17) and ([f]C)(w) =1W n+1Z Γf(x) dσ |x−w|n−1(x−w)|, w∈ Rn+1\\Γ.(2.18) 3 Before discussing boundary behaviors of the Cauchy type integrals, we need introduce the Cauchy principal value integral. Sketching a sphereO(t, δ) with center att∈Γ and sufficiently small radiusδ >0,we obtain a piece of surface Γ(t, δ) from Γ.Next we define the Cauchy principal value integral by the limit \u0010 C[f]\u0011 (t) =1W n+1Z ΓE(x−t)dσf(x) =: lim δ→0+1W n+1Z Γ\\Γ(t, δ)E(x−t)dσf(x), t∈Γ.(2.19) Similarly, \u0010 [f]C\u0011 (t) =1W n+1Z Γf(x)dσ E(x−t) =: lim δ→0+1W n+1Z Γ\\Γ(t, δ)f(x)dσ E(x−t), t∈Γ.(2.20) Example 2.1(see [14]) Iff≡1, then the Cauchy principal value integral \u0010 C[1]\u0011 (t) =\u0010 [1]C\u0011 (t) =1 2, t∈Γ.(2.21) In general, the H¨ older condition of the density function is a sufficient condition for existence of the Cauchy principal value integrals. Definition 2.2Letf:D→C(V n,s). If there exists a constantM >0such that, for anyx, y∈D, f(x)−f(y) ≤M x−y µ (0< µ≤1),(2.22) then we say f to be H¨ older continuous onD, denoted byf∈Hµ(D). The constantMis called a H¨ older constant off,µis called H¨ older index off. If the orderµis not emphasized, it may be written briefly by f∈H(D)orH. Theorem 2.3 (Existence of the Cauchy principal integral[14,15])Iff∈H(Γ), then Cauchy princi- pal integrals\u0000 C[f]\u0001 (t)and\u0000 [f]C\u0001 (t)exist for eacht∈Γ. More precisely, \u0010 C[f]\u0011 (t) =\u0010 ∆[f]\u0011 (t) +1 2f(t),\u0010 [f]C\u0011 (t) =\u0010 [f]∆\u0011 (t) +1 2f(t),(2.23) where \u0010 ∆[f]\u0011 (t) =1W n+1Z ΓE(x−t) dθh f(x)−f(t)i ,\u0010 [f]∆\u0011 (t) =1W n+1Z Γh f(x)−f(t)i dθ E(x−t) (2.24) are two improper integrals.

    "∆[f]\u0011 (t) =1W n+1Z ΓE(x−t) dθh f(x)−f(t)i ,\u0010 [f]∆\u0011 (t) =1W n+1Z Γh f(x)−f(t)i dθ E(x−t) (2.24) are two improper integrals. In earlier studies of boundary behavior of the Cauchy type integrals, researchers always assumed that Γ was a Liapunov surface [18, 26, 27]. The hypothesis of the Liapunov surface is too strong for discussing the boundary behavior. It is well known that the condition of smooth curve is enough for the classical one complex variable case. The reason for such difference comes from the common proof used to discuss the Clifford analysis case. In fact, the discussion for the Clifford analysis case is similar to that for the classical one complex variable case. We have found the substitute of the chord-arc inequality so that the convergence of improper integrals in (2.24) are easily proved. That is just the concept of standard surface proposed by Du in [14,15]. The Cauchy type integrals (2.3) and (2.4) with the H¨ older continuous densityfare just sectionally regular with Γ as the jump surface. Their boundary values satisfy the Sochocki–Plemelj formula and Privalov– Muskhelishvili theorem. We state these results in an unified framework, which is collectively called 2P theorem. Introduce the following singular integral operators \u0010 S+[f]\u0011 (w) =  \u0010 C[f]\u0011 (z),ifw∈Ω+, 1 2f(t) +\u0010 C[f]\u0011 (t),ifw=t∈Γ,(2.25) 4 \u0010 S−[f]\u0011 (w) =  \u0010 C[f]\u0011 (w),ifw∈Ω−, −1 2f(t) +\u0010 C[f]\u0011 (t),ifw=t∈Γ,(2.26) \u0010 [f]S+\u0011 (w) =  \u0010 [f]C\u0011 (w),ifw∈Ω+, 1 2f(t) +\u0010 [f]C\u0011 (t),ifw=t∈Γ,(2.27) \u0010 [f]S−\u0011 (w) =  \u0010 [f]C\u0011 (w),ifw∈Ω−, −1 2f(t) +\u0010 [f]C\u0011 (t),ifw=t∈Γ.(2.28) Theorem 2.4 (2P theorem[14,15])Iff∈Hµ(Γ), then S+[f],[f]S+∈  Hµ\u0010 Ω+\u0011 ,if0< µ <1, Hν\u0010 Ω+\u0011 ,ifµ= 1, ν <1,(2.29) S−[f],[f]S−∈  Hµ\u0010 Ω−\u0011 ,if0< µ <1, Hν\u0010 Ω−\u0011 ,ifµ= 1, ν <1.(2.30) The 2P Theorem is a fundamental theorem of boundary behavior of Cauchy type integrals. Remark 2.2Noting the continuity ofS±[f] and [f]S±, at once the Sochocki–Plemelj formulae for the boundary values of the Cauchy type integralsS[f] and [f]Sbecome a corollary of the 2P Theorem.

The earliest result for the Sochocki–Plemelj formula in Clifford analysis is given by Iftimie [27]. His results took the Cauchy type integrals over a Liapunov surface and the limits along non-tangent direction. He followed the classical method in [32] to prove those results, that seems a little complicated. In fact, in 1980, Jinyuan Du has given a simple proof of the Sochocki–Plemelj formulae, the Privalov theorem as well as Muskhelishvili theorem for Cauchy type integrals in the classical one complex variable case [16,29].

    "theorem as well as Muskhelishvili theorem for Cauchy type integrals in the classical one complex variable case [16,29]. The method in [16] still works to prove the Plemelj formulae and the Privalov–Muskhelishvili theorems for Cauchy type integrals in Clifford analysis case [14], even in the case of Cauchy type integrals with value in a universal Clifford algebral [15]. The 2P Theorem here also improves the corresponding result in [51]. In [51], Zhang obtained the result with the H¨ older index (µ−ϵ) using the method in [16]. Remark 2.4The Cauchy principle value integrals (2.19) and (2.20) are H¨ older continuous by 2P theorem.

In particular, iff∈Hµ(Γ),thenC[f]∈Hµ(Γ)withµ <1;iff∈H1(Γ),then C[f]∈Hν(Γ)for anyν <1. 5 3 Basic theorems on regular functions Since the Sochocki–Plemelj formula has been built, a large number of studies on various boundary value problems in the Clifford analysis arise. Obviously,E+S[g] is the solution of the jump problem (2.2) for any entire functionE. But ones disregard to prove the fact that they are just all solutions of the jump (2.2) over a long period of time. This can be ascribed to the simpler Painlev´ e problem. Painlev´ e problem. Find a sectionally regular function Φ, with Γ as its jump surface, satisfying the boundary value condition Φ+(x) = Φ−(x), x∈Γ.(3.1) Theorem 3.1 (see [31])All solutions of Painlev´ e problem are entire functions. This is based on the following theorem. Theorem 3.2 (Painlev´ e theorem[31])LetΩ⊂ Rn+1be an open domain andΓ⊂ΩaC1-smooth surface. Iffis left(right)regular inΩ\\Γandf∈C(Ω, C(V n)\u0001 , thenfis left(right)regular inΩ. Painlev´ e problem is one of the foundations for solving Riemann boundary value problems, but it has not been seriously treated in Clifford analysis up to now. Painlev´ e theorem problem deals the removable singularity of regular functions on the whole surface. Recently, Luo and Du have given a simple proof of the Painlev´ e theorem in [31], which is based upon 3C theorems (Cauchy type integral theorem, Cauchy–Goursat theorem and the generalized Cauchy’s integral formula). In general, the regular functions defined on a region are continuous but not regular to its boundary in discussing its boundary behavior, for example, Φ+and Φ−in the jump problem (2.2). So the generalized Cauchy’s theorem and the generalized Cauchy’s integral formula are inevitable in the study of BVPs. Definition 3.1LetΩ⊂ Rn+1be a bounded open domain and∂Ωa smooth or piecewise smooth surface. Ωis called a para-ball if∀f, g∈C\u0000 Ω, C(V n)\u0001 and∀ϵ >0, there is an open domainΩ ϵwith the piecewise smooth surface∂Ω ϵ, such that Ωϵ⊂Ωand Z ∂Ωϵg(x)dσf(x)−Z ∂Ωg(x)dσf(x) < ϵ.(3.2) The boundary of a para-ball is called a para-sphere. Theorem 3.3 ( Cauchy-Goursat theorem[31])LetΩ⊂ Rn+1be a para-ball. Iffis left regular inΩ and continuous on its closure Ω,gis right regular inΩand continuous on Ω, then Z ∂Ωg(x)dσf(x) = 0.(3.3) Definition 3.2LetΩ⊂ Rn+1be a bounded open domain and∂Ωa smooth or piecewise smooth surface with the induced orientation byΩ.Ωis called a strong para-ball if for givenw∈Ωand∀ϵ >0, there are a domain Ω∗with the piecewise smooth surface∂Ω ∗oriented byΩ ∗and a numberρ >0such that w∈Ω◦ ∗,Ω∗⊆Ω, ∂Ω ∗∈U(∂Ω, ρ) (3.4)",

The boundary of a strong para-ball is called a strong para-sphere. 6 Theorem 3.4 (Generalized Cauchy’s integral formula)LetΩ⊂ Rn+1be a strong para-ball. Iffis left regular inΩand continuous on Ω,gis right regular inΩand continuous on Ω, then 1W n+1Z ∂ΩE(x−w) dσ f(x) =(f(w), when w∈Ω, 0, when w∈ Rn+1\\Ω,(3.7) 1W n+1Z ∂Ωg(x) dσ E(x−w) =(g(w), when w∈Ω, 0, when w∈ Rn+1\\Ω.(3.8) Remark 3.1In fact, Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.4 (collectively called 2C theorems) only schemed out a method to extend weak versions of Cauchy’s theorem and Cauchy’s integral formula (i.e., the classical Cauchy’s theorem and Cauchy’s integral formula, e.g., see [7]) in principle. It transfers the key to the difficult question on what kind of domains are para-ball or strong para-ball. Obviously, the ballSninRn+1is a strong para-ball. Thus, the Cauchy-Goursat theorem and the generalized Cauchy’s integral formula hold onSn. In [52], Zhang Zhongxiang specifically proved that Cauchy-Goursat theorem holds on 2-dimensional ball. R. Z. Yeh established a kind of 2C theorems in [48]. Those theorems require Ω must be a regular domain inRn+1,even Ω being cut down a small ball is also a regular domain. One thus runs into difficulties on classifying regular domains. In [5], to solve some quaternionic Riemann boundary value problems, R. Abreu and J. Bory presented other kinds of generalized Cauchy integral formulas involving certain geometric measure theoretic concepts. Those generalized Cauchy integral formulas cannot be deduced directly from the Gauss-Green theorem in geometric measure theory unless appending the condition that each component of D[f] is absolutely integrable on Ω. In the following we shall illustrate that the domains bounded by smooth surfaces and a special type of piecewise smooth surfaces are strong para-balls. Example 3.1Let Ω⊂ Rn+1be a bounded open domain and its boundary∂Ω aC-smooth surface with the induced orientation by Ω. Then Ω is a strong para-ball. Definition 3.3Fixℓ∈ {0,1,···, n}. Letφ+andφ−be elementaryC1-smooth surfaces inRn+1with the explicit representations xℓ=φ±\u0000 uℓ\u0001 , uℓ=\u0000 x0,···, x ℓ−1, xℓ+1,···, x n\u0001 ∈Uℓ (3.9) where the parametric domainU ℓis an open domain inRncovering the cube Iℓ=\b uℓ, a− k≤xk≤a+ k, k= 0,···, ℓ−1, ℓ+ 1,···, n .(3.10) Ifφ−\u0000 uℓ\u0001 < φ+\u0000 uℓ\u0001 foruℓ∈Uℓ, we call Πℓ=n x, x=\u0000 x0, x1,···, x n\u0001 ∈ Rn+1, φ−\u0000 uℓ\u0001 <xℓ<φ+\u0000 uℓ\u0001 , a− j<xj<a+ j, j̸=ℓo (3.11) thex ℓ-type cylindrical body with crooked tips inRn+1. Example 3.2LetΠℓbe ax ℓ-type cylindrical body with crooked tips inRn+1. If its boundary∂Πℓis oriented by the exterior normal, then it is a strong para-ball. The authors in [31] give the two examples in detail. Now we show some useful cases of 2C theorem.

Theorem 3.8 (Version of Cauchy’s integrals theorem in span form)Iffis left regular onΩ+and H¨ older continuous toΓ, then \u0010 C[f]\u0011 (w) =1W n+1Z Γx−w |x−w|n+1dσf(x) = span(Γ, w)f(w), w∈ Rn+1(3.20) where span(Γ, w) =  1, w∈Ω+, 1 2, w∈Γ, 0, w∈Ω−(3.21) is thespanatwwith respect toΓ. Remark 3.2The span about Ω atwmay be visually understood as follows. Forw∈Ω+, since its entire neighborhood lies in Ω+, so span = 1. Forw∈Ω−, since its entire neighborhood lies in Ω−, so span = 0. Forw∈Γ, its neighborhood partly lies both Ω+and Ω−, moreover Γ is smooth, so span =1 2. 8 To discuss behavior of a regular function, now we introduce its order at the infinity. Definition 3.4LetΦbe regular on some neighborhood of∞.If there exists an integermsuch that 0<lim sup |x|→+∞|x|−m|Φ(x)|<+∞(3.22) thenmis called the order ofΦat∞, that is denoted byOrd (Φ,∞) =m.Whenf≡0,we have that Ord(f,∞) =−∞. In order to deal with the order issue at the infinity of regular functions, we need to review Taylor expansion of entire functions and expansion of the Cauchy type integral. For the Taylor series and the Laurent series theory in Clifford analysis, we refer to [7,10,11,48,49]. LetZ= (z 1,···, z n) andα= [α 1, α2,···, α n],where zj’s are hypercomplex variables given by zj=zj(x) =x je0−x0ej, x∈ Rn+1,(j= 1,···, n).(3.23) Note that the functionsz jare biregular [7,10,11,24,48,49], andα j’s are nonnegative integers. The symmetry powerZαis a biregular function inRn+1,defined as the sum of all possiblez iproducts, each of which containsz ifactor exactlyα itimes. For example, forn= 2 (z1, z2)[0,0]= 1,(z 1, z2)[1,1]=z1z2+z2z1,(z 1, z2)[2,0]=z2 1.(3.24) LetN 0stand for the set{0,1,2,···,}. Write",

Thenfcan be expanded into a Taylor series f(x) =∞X k=0Pk[f](x), x∈ Rn+1(3.27) where Pk[f](x) =1 k!X |α|=kZα(x)\u0002 ∂αf\u0003 (0).(3.28) Similarly, iffis right entire, then Pr k[f](x) =1 k!X |α|=k\u0002 ∂αf\u0003 (0)Zα(x).(3.29) Remark 3.3Since \u0002 ∂αf\u0003 (0) =(−1)|α| W n+1Z ∂B(0,R)\u0002 ∂αE\u0003 (x) dσ f(x), R∈(0,+∞),(3.30) we have Pk[f](x) ≤M Ck+1 k+n−1\u0010 1 +k2\u0011|x|k Rksupn f(y) ,|y|=Ro ,|x|< R,(3.31) where the constantM >0 only depends upon the dimension (n+ 1). We immediately obtain the following important result through (3.27)-(3.31). 9 Theorem 3.10 (Liouville type theorem)Iffis entire withOrd(f,∞)≤m, then it is a hyperpolynomial of degreem.

Example 3.3 ([31])A hypercomplex polynomialP mis of degreemif and only iford(P m,∞) =m. Theorem 3.11 (Laurent’s expansion[7])The Cauchy type integralS[g]has the Laurent series expansion near the infinity \u0010 S[g]\u0011 (w) =−∞X k=0Qk(w), w > ρ= max\b |x|, x∈Γ ,(3.34) where Qk(w) =X |α|=k\u0002 ∂αE\u0003 (w)1 |α|!Z ΓZα(x)dσg(x).(3.35) moreover, Qk(w) ≤M Ck+1 k+n−1\u0010 1 +k2\u0011ρk w|n+kZ Γ g(x)|ds,|w|> ρ,(3.36) where the constantM >0only depends upon the dimensionn.

Rmjump problem.Find a sectionally regular function Φ, with Γ as its jump surface, satisfying the boundary value condition and the growth condition at the infinity ( Φ+(x) = Φ−(x) +g(x), x∈Γ, Ord (Φ,∞)≤m,(4.1) whereg∈H(Γ). The simplestR mproblem is the case of (4.1) wheng= 0, which is called Liouville problem.

    "infinity ( Φ+(x) = Φ−(x) +g(x), x∈Γ, Ord (Φ,∞)≤m,(4.1) whereg∈H(Γ). The simplestR mproblem is the case of (4.1) wheng= 0, which is called Liouville problem. Liouville problem.Find a sectionally regular function Φ, with Γ as its jump surface, satisfying the boundary value condition and the growth condition at the infinity ( Φ+(x) = Φ−(x), x∈Γ, Ord (Φ,∞)≤m.(4.2) Obviously, any hypercomplex symmetric polynomials of degree not exceedingmis the solution of Liouville problem (4.2). On the other hand, any solution of Liouville problem (4.2) is a symmetric polynomial of degree not exceedingmby Theorem 3.1 and Example 3.3. Lemma 4.1The solutions of the Liouville problem(4.2)are all hypercomplex symmetric polynomials of degree not exceedingm. Below we firstly solve jumpR −nproblem, i.e., (4.1) withm=−n,that is a fundamental case ofR m problem, then the generalR mjump problem. JumpR −nproblem.Find a sectionally regular function Φ, with Γ as its jump surface, such that ( Φ+(x)−Φ−(x) =g(x), x∈Γ, Ord (Φ,∞)≤ −n,(4.3) whereg∈H(Γ). By the Sochocki-Plemelj formulae and Example 3.4, we know thatS[g] ([g]S) is just the solution of the jumpR −nproblem. Let ∆ =S[g]−Ψ, then Ψ is the solution of theR −nproblem if and only if ∆ is the solution of the Liouville problem (4.2) withm=−n.By Lemma 4.1, we get ∆ = 0,that is to say thatS[g] is the unique solution of the jumpR −nproblem. Then we have the following Lemma. Lemma 4.2TheR −njump problem(4.3)has the unique solutionS[g] ([g]S). Now we discuss theR mproblem (4.1), which is divided into three cases. Below we only find the left regular solution. Case1:m≥0. Firstly,S[g] is a solution by Lemma 4.2. Secondly, letting ∆ =S[g]−Ψ, then Ψ is the solution of theR mproblem if and only if ∆ is the solution of the Liouville problem (4.2). By quoting 11 Lemma 4.1, we get ∆ =P m,that is arbitrary hypercomplex polynomial of degree not exceedingmdenoted byP m∈QH m.Thus, the general solution of theR mproblem (4.1) is Φ(w) =\u0010 S[g]\u0011 (w) +mX |α|=0Zαcα (4.4) wherec α’s areCm n+m arbitrary hypercomplex constants. Case2:−n≤m <0.S[g] is a solution by Lemma 4.2. Similarly, Ψ is the solution of the jumpR m problem if and only if ∆ is the solution of the Liouville problem (4.2). Hence, quoting Lemma 4.1, we have ∆ = 0. Thus, theR mproblem (4.1) has unique solutionS[g]. Case3:m <−n. By Lemma 4.2, if the jump problem is solvable then its solution must be the solution ofR−nproblemS[g]. Conversely, ifS[g] is the solution of the jump problemR −n, then, by Example 3.4 it must satisfy the conditions of solvability Z ΓZα(x)dσg(x) = 0,|α|= 0,1,···,−(n−1 +m).(4.5) Summarizing the above discussions, we have the following result. Theorem 4.1For the jump problemR m(4.1), the general solution is stated in three cases according to values ofm. (1)Whenm≥0, the jump problem is solvable, its general solution is given by(4.4)withCm n+m free hypercomplex constants. (2)When−n≤m <0, the jump problem has a unique solutionS[g]. (3)Whenm <−n, the jump problem has a unique solutionS[g]if and only if theCn −m−1 conditions of solvability in(4.5)are satisfied. Remark 4.1The number ofαwith|α|=kisCn−1 k+n−1=Ck k+n−1 .Hence the number ofc α’s in (4.4) is just Cm n+m. Similarly, (4.5) includesCn −m−1",
    "constants. (2)When−n≤m <0, the jump problem has a unique solutionS[g]. (3)Whenm <−n, the jump problem has a unique solutionS[g]if and only if theCn −m−1 conditions of solvability in(4.5)are satisfied. Remark 4.1The number ofαwith|α|=kisCn−1 k+n−1=Ck k+n−1 .Hence the number ofc α’s in (4.4) is just Cm n+m. Similarly, (4.5) includesCn −m−1 conditions of solvability. Remark 4.2There is no regular functionFnear the infinity such that Ord(g,∞) =mwith−n < m <0. In fact, ifg(w) is regular on|w|> R, taking Γ ={w,|w|= 2R}(4.6) theng∈H(Γ) and Φ(w) =( 0,|w|<2R, g(w),|w|>2R(4.7) is the solution of the jumpR −nproblem (4.3), so Φ =S[g] by Theorem 4.1, which results in Ord(g,∞)≤ −n. This fact is very interesting, since there is analytic function near the infinity with arbitrary order in the classical complex analysis. Rmproblem with constant gapG. Find a sectionally left regular function Φ, with the jump surface Γ, satisfying the boundary value condition and the growth condition at the infinity ( Φ+(x) = Φ−(x)G+g(x), x∈Γ, Ord (Φ,∞)≤m,(4.8) whereg∈H(Γ) andGis an invertible hypercomplex constant. Let Ψ = ΦX−1, theR mproblem (4.8) becomes aR mjump problem for Ψ. So, we obtain immediately the following result. 12 Lemma 4.3The general solution of theR mproblem(4.8)is Φ(w) =h\u0010 S\u0002 g\u0003\u0011 (w) +P m(w)i X(w), w̸∈Γ,(4.9) where X(w) =( 1, w∈Ω+, G−1, w∈Ω−,(4.10) andP mis an arbitrary hypercomplex symmetric polynomial of degree not exceedingm. Whenm <−n, then the jump problem has a unique solution(4.9)withP m= 0if and only if the followingCn −m−1 conditions of solvability Z ΓZα(x)dσg(x) = 0,|α|= 0,1,···,−(n−1 +m) (4.11) are fulfilled. Remark 4.3In [50], since the order at the infinity is not well defined, Zhang and Du only discuss theR problem, i.e., the growth condition at the infinity of (4.8) is ignored. Still, the result there must be based on the Painlev´ e problem 2.3, which is not discussed in earlier works. In [13], we reproved the Painlev´ e problem by the version of Cauchy’s integral theorem in span form (3.20), but the latter is based on the generalized 2C theorems, that is still not proved there. GeneralR mproblem.Find a sectionally left regular function Φ, with Γ as its jump surface, satisfying the boundary value condition and the growth condition at the infinity (Φ+(x) = Φ−(x)G(x) +g(x), x∈Γ, Ord (Φ,∞)≤m,(4.12) whereG, g∈H(Γ). Remark 4.4The generalR mproblem(4.12)is an open problem up to now. We believe that there will arise new tools to solve this problem. 5 Singular integral equations Singular integral equations of higher dimensions are frequently encountered in physical and engineering applications. There is very close link between boundary value problems and singular integral equations. We consider the singular integral equation φ(t)a(t) +2W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσφ(x)k(x, t) =f(t), t∈Γ,(5.1) where the input functionk∈H(Γ×Γ),a, f∈H(Γ) and the output functionφ∈H(Γ). Since the operator \u0010 K[φ]\u0011 (t) =2W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσφ(x)\u0002 k(x, t)−k(t, t)\u0003 (5.2) is compact, we will consider the characteristic equation φ(t)a(t) +2W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσφ(x)b(t) =f(t), t∈Γ.(5.3) Let Φ(z) =1W n+1Z Γx−z |x−z|n+1dσφ(x), z̸∈Γ.(5.4) 13 Then, from (5.4) we get the Riemann boundary problem (Φ+(t)\u0002 a(t) +b(t)\u0003 = Φ−(t)\u0002 a(t)−b(t)\u0003 +f(t), t∈Γ, Φ(∞) = 0.(5.5) Lemma 5.1Ifφis the solution of the singular",
    "is compact, we will consider the characteristic equation φ(t)a(t) +2W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσφ(x)b(t) =f(t), t∈Γ.(5.3) Let Φ(z) =1W n+1Z Γx−z |x−z|n+1dσφ(x), z̸∈Γ.(5.4) 13 Then, from (5.4) we get the Riemann boundary problem (Φ+(t)\u0002 a(t) +b(t)\u0003 = Φ−(t)\u0002 a(t)−b(t)\u0003 +f(t), t∈Γ, Φ(∞) = 0.(5.5) Lemma 5.1Ifφis the solution of the singular integral equation(5.3),thenΦgiven in(5.4)is the solution of the Riemann boundary problem(5.5). Inversely, ifΦis the solution of Riemann boundary problem(5.5), thenφ(t) = Φ+(t)−Φ−(t)is the solution of the singular integral equation(5.3). Due to obstacles not being overcome in the generalR mproblem (5.5),the general case of (5.3) is also an open problem, a special case of which is solved. Assume that botha(t) +b(t) anda(t)−b(t) are inversable and a(t)−b(t) a(t) +b(t)|=G(5.6) is a hypercomplex constant, then the singular integral equation (5.3) is reduced to anR −1problem as follows.   Φ+(t) = Φ−(t)a(t)−b(t) a(t) +b(t)|+f(t) a(t) +b(t)|, t∈Γ, Φ(∞) = 0.(5.7) By Lemma 5.1 and Theorem 4.1, we have Theorem 5.1Singular integral equation(5.3)has an unique solution ϕ(t)=f(t) 2\u00121 a(t)+b(t)+1 a(t)−b(t)\u0013 −2W nZ Γx−t |x−t|ndσf(x) a(x)−b(x)|b(x) a(x) +b(x)|, t∈Γ.(5.8) Whilea= 0,b= 1, we get the inversion formula for Cauchy principal value integral. Theorem 5.2 (Inversion formula for Cauchy principal value integral[31,50])Iff∈H(Γ), then f(t) =1W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσφ(x)⇐⇒φ(t) =1W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσf(x).(5.9) Remark 5.1The inversion formula for Cauchy principal value integral may also be directly obtained from Theorem 3.8. It shows the singular integral operator \u0010 S[f]\u0011 (t) =1W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσf(x), t∈Γ (5.10) is idempotent, i.e.,S2=IwhereIis the identity operator. Moreover, from f(t) =1W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσx1W n+1Z Γτ−x |τ−x|n+1dστf(τ), t∈Γ,(5.11) and [31]Z ΓE(x−t)dσ E(τ−x) = 0, τ, t∈Γ, τ̸=t,(5.12) we see that the inversion formula for Cauchy principal value integral is just the Poincar´ e–Bertrand formula off, i.e.,Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσx\u0014Z Γτ−x |τ−x|n+1dστf(τ)\u0015 =\u0014W n+1 2\u00152 f(t) +Z Γ\u0014Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσxτ−x |τ−x|n+1\u0015 dστf(τ), t∈Γ.(5.13) 14 The general Poincar´ e–Bertrand formula Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσx\u0014Z Γτ−x |τ−x|n+1dστk(τ, x)\u0015 −\u0014W n+1 2\u00152 k(t, t) =nP k=0(−1)kZ Γ\u0014Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσxτ−x |τ−x|n+1ekk(τ, x)\u0015 dbτk, t∈Γ(5.14) is an open problem, which will be an important tool for discussing singular integral equations. We hope that the following conjecture is true, but its proof is not straightforward. Conjecture [Poincar´ e–Bertrand formula].Ifk∈H(Γ×Γ), then(5.14)holds. Other studies for singular integral equations can be found in the mentioned references. 6 Dirichlet boundary value problems Throughout this section, we assume that Ω = Ω+is a bounded open domain inRn+1with aC1-smooth boundary Γ, Γ is oriented by exterior normal. Regular (entire) function means left regular (entire) function. All results for the right regular (entire) function can be similarly obtained. IfGin the boundary condition of (4.8) equals to 0 and the regular function Φ that is found is in Ω,then the boundary value problem will become to the Dirichlet boundary value problem. There are several cases based on different continuity of given function. Dirichlet problem withHcontinuous boundary function.Find a left regular function Φ on Ω, satisfying the boundary value condition Φ+(x) =g(x), x∈Γ,(6.1) whereg∈H(Γ) is given. This problem will be simply solved. Firstly, if Φ is the solution of the problem (6.1), by the generalized Cauchy’s integral formula in Theorem 3.6 we have Φ(w)",
    "problem withHcontinuous boundary function.Find a left regular function Φ on Ω, satisfying the boundary value condition Φ+(x) =g(x), x∈Γ,(6.1) whereg∈H(Γ) is given. This problem will be simply solved. Firstly, if Φ is the solution of the problem (6.1), by the generalized Cauchy’s integral formula in Theorem 3.6 we have Φ(w) =\u0000 S[g]\u0001 (w) =1W n+1Z Γx−w |x−w|n+1dσg(x), w∈Ω,(6.2) and\u0000 S−[g]\u0001 (w) =1W n+1Z Γx−w |x−w|n+1dσg(x) = 0, w∈Ω−=Rn+1\\Ω.(6.3) Secondly, if (6.3) holds, then by Sochocki-Plemelj formulae (2.31) we know that (6.2) is just the solution of Dirichlet problem (6.1). Theorem 6.1Ifg∈H(Γ)then the Dirichlet problem(6.1)has the unique solution(6.2)if and only uf(6.3) is satisfied. By Theorem 3.8, Theorem 6.1 can be written in another form as follows. Theorem 6.2Ifg∈H(Γ)then the Dirichlet problem(6.1)has the unique solution(6.2)if and only if \u0000 S[g]\u0001 (t) =1W n+1Z Γx−t |x−t|n+1dσg(x) =1 2g(t), t∈Γ (6.4) holds. Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 6.2 can be stated together. 15 Theorem 6.3 (Conditions forHcontinuous boundary value of regular function)A functionf∈ H(Γ)is the boundary value of a regular functionΦinΩif and only iffsatisfies(6.3)or(6.4). Dirichlet problem with continuous boundary function.Find a left regular function Φ on Ω, satisfying the boundary value condition Φ+(x) =g(x), x∈Γ,(6.5) whereg∈C(Γ) is given. In this case, sinceg∈C(Γ),the Sochocki-Plemelj formula is failed in general. To obtain the corresponding result to Theorem 6.1 we need to find a substitute of the Sochocki-Plemelj formula. To do so, some tools should be introduced (see [31]). Lemma 6.1 (Quasi normal field[31])Suppose thatΓ⊂ Rn+1is a compact smooth surface andc∈(0,1) is a constant. Then there exists aC1-mappingM: Γ→Snsuch that\u0000 M(p), N(p)\u0001 ≥cfor eachp∈Γ, where Snis the unit sphere inRn+1,Nis a continuous unit onΓ. The direction fieldM(p) (p∈Γ) in the above lemma is called aC1-unitc-quasi normal field on Γ associated with the normal fieldN. Lemma 6.2 (Tubular neighborhood formed quasi normal lines[31])LetΓ⊂ Rn+1be a compact C1-surface andMaC1-unitc-quasi normal field onΓ. Then there exists a numberh >0such that, for any ϵ∈(0, h), (1)I p,ϵ∩Iq,ϵ=∅, wherep, q∈Γ,p̸=qand Ip,ϵ=\b p+λM(p),−ϵ < λ < ϵ ; (6.6) (2)V ϵis an open neighborhood inRn+1ofΓ, where Vϵ=\b p+λM(p), p∈Γ,−ϵ < λ < ϵ .(6.7) Remark 6.1Clearly, forϵ < h, Vϵ=[ p∈ΓIp,ϵ=[ p∈Γ\b p+λM(p),−ϵ < λ < ϵ , Ip,ϵ\\ Iq,ϵ=∅(p̸=q).(6.8) That is to say, through each point of the neighborhoodV ϵof Γ there passes a unique quasi normal lineI p,ϵof length 2ϵwith respect toC1-quasi normalM(p).V ϵis then called a tubular neighborhood of Γ with respect toC1-unitc-quasi normalM(p), briefly a tubular neighborhood of Γ. For convenience, we callhan allowable width number of the tubular neighborhoodV ϵ. Lemma 6.3 (Inner and exterior quasi normal[31])IfN(p)is the unit inner normal andM(p)is a C1-unitc-quasi normal field onΓassociated withN, then \u0000 p, p+ℓM(p)\u0001 ⊆Ω+,\u0000 p, p−ℓM(p)\u0001 ⊆Ω−,(6.9) whereℓis some a positive real number,(a, b)stands for the line segment fromatob. LetV ℓbe a tubular neighborhood of Γ. Now we construct a function onV+ ℓ=V ℓ∩Ω as follows. For w∈ V+ ℓ, by the above Lemmas and Remark, we know that there exist uniquep∈Γ andλ∈(0, ℓ), such that w=p+λM(p).(6.10) Then let wM=p−λM(p),(6.11) which is called the symmetric point ofwaboutpon the line segment\u0000 p+hM(p), p−hM(p)\u0001 ,wherehis an allowable width number. We have 16 w∈Ω+, w",
    "ℓ=V ℓ∩Ω as follows. For w∈ V+ ℓ, by the above Lemmas and Remark, we know that there exist uniquep∈Γ andλ∈(0, ℓ), such that w=p+λM(p).(6.10) Then let wM=p−λM(p),(6.11) which is called the symmetric point ofwaboutpon the line segment\u0000 p+hM(p), p−hM(p)\u0001 ,wherehis an allowable width number. We have 16 w∈Ω+, w M∈Ω−.(6.12) So, let V+ ℓ=Vℓ∩Ω (ℓ < h) (6.13) that is an open set, forf∈C(Γ) we construct a function ∆[f]:V+ ℓ→C(V n) by \u0010 ∆S[f]\u0011 (w) =\u0010 S[f]\u0011 (w)−\u0010 S[f]\u0011\u0000 wM\u0001 , w∈ V+ ℓ,(6.14) that is called the symmetric difference ofS. In [31], we obtain the following result, which is a form of Sochocki-Plemelj formula in case of the continuous density. Theorem 6.4Iff∈C(Γ), then lim w→p, w∈V+ ℓ\u0010 ∆S[f]\u0011 (w) =f(p), p∈Γ,(6.15) i.e., lim w→p, w∈V+ ℓh\u0010 S[f]\u0011 (w)−\u0010 S[f]\u0011\u0000 wM\u0001i =f(p), p∈Γ,(6.16) and the limit converges uniformly with respect top∈Γ. By using the above Sochocki-Plemelj formula, now we can give the solution and the conditions of solvability for the Dirichlet problem (6.5) with continuous boundary function. Theorem 6.5Iff∈C(Γ), then the Dirichlet problem(6.5)has the unique solution(6.2)if and only if(6.3) is satisfied. Theorem 6.6 (Conditions for continuous boundary value of a regular function)A necessary and sufficient condition for a functionf∈H(Γ)to be the boundary value of a functionΦregular inΩis(6.3).
