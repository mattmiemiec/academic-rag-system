    "Spectral Broadening of Landau Levels by a Penetrable Circular Wall Masahiro Kaminaga Abstract We study the two–dimensionalmagnetic Schr¨ odinger operatorwit h a penetrable circular wall modeled by a δ–interaction. Using the boundary triple approach we classify all self–adjoint extensions an d obtain Krein’s resolvent formula, showing that the essential spect rum coincides with the Landau levels. The wall breaks their inﬁnite degen- eracy and produces a spectral broadening: each Landau level be comes an accumulation point of discrete eigenvalues from one side. In the circular case, rotational symmetry reduces the eigenvalue proble m to scalar equations with explicit Weyl coeﬃcients. We prove strict mono - tonicity, ensuring that each angular momentum channel contribut es at most one eigenvalue per gap, and derive asymptotics showing that t he boundarycoeﬃcients decayfasterthan anyexponential, explainin gthe strong localization of the broadened spectrum. Numerical simulatio ns are consistent with these results. 1 Introduction Landau levels are a characteristic feature of quantum mecha nics in a mag- netic ﬁeld. They represent an inﬁnite degeneracy of energy l evels, reﬂecting the high symmetry of cyclotron motion. Understanding how th is delicate structure is modiﬁed under perturbations has been a central theme in the spectral theory of magnetic Schr¨ odinger operators. In the planar case with a constant magnetic ﬁeld B >0, the free Hamil- tonian HB,0= (−i∇−A)2(1.1) has spectrum consisting only of the inﬁnitely degenerate ei genvalues Λn=B(2n+1), n∈N0, (1.2) known as the Landau levels; see, for instance, [17]. It is wel l known that under various perturbations, discrete eigenvalues may app ear close to these levels (cf. [20, 18, 9]). Among the most natural perturbations are singular interact ions sup- ported on lower-dimensional sets. δ–type interactions provide models of 1arXiv:2509.08377v1 [math-ph] 10 Sep 2025 thin barriers or penetrable–walls and admit a rigorous oper ator-theoretic treatment[1, 2, 13]. Even without a magnetic ﬁeld, such inte ractions can produce curvature-induced bound states [11, 12]. In the mag netic case, δ– interactions supportedongeneralcurveswereshowntobrea kthedegeneracy ofLandaulevels andtoproducediscreteeigenvalues accumu latingnearthem [3, 4, 5]. These results, however, are mainly qualitative: t hey establish the existence of clusters but do not give a detailed description of their in ternal structure. The aim of this paper is to present a detailed and explicit ana lysis of thetwo-dimensional Landau Hamiltonian with a penetrable circular wall, that is, aδ–interaction supported on the circle Sa={x∈R2:|x|=a}. Formally, the model can be written as HB,α=HB,0+α(x)δ(|x| −a), (1.3) whereδ(|x|−a) denotes the Dirac interaction supported on Sa. A rigorous deﬁnition of HB,αwill be given later in the framework of boundary triples. By Weyl’s theorem, the Landau levels Λ nremain in the essential spec- trum forα/\\e}atio\\slash= 0. However, they are no longer eigenvalues of inﬁnite multi - plicity; instead, each Λ nbecomes an accumulation point of inﬁnitely many ﬁnite-multiplicity eigenvalues created by the wall.

An asymptotic analysis of the boundary coeﬃcients cn,m(Proposi- tion 16) shows that they decay faster than any exponential in |m|, which explains the strong localization of the broadened spectrum . Numerical sim- ulations are consistent with these results. We restrict our selves here to the two-dimensional case, where genuine spectral broadening o f Landau levels occurs. In addition to these analytic results, the circular wall is n ot only the simplest nontrivial geometry that allows a fully explicit t reatment, but also provides new physical insight: the inﬁnite degeneracy of La ndau levels is de- composed into resonant angular momentum modes, whose inter action with the boundary governs the ﬁne spectral structure. This mecha nism, not vis- ible in the abstract theory, shows how geometry inﬂuences lo calization in magnetic quantum systems. Novelty compared with previous work. The general theory developed in [3, 4, 5] shows the existence of eigenvalue clusters near L andau levels forδ–interactions supported on curves of arbitrary shape, but t he results are essentially qualitative. By focusing on the circular ge ometry, we obtain 2 explicit and quantitative information on the ﬁne structure of the broadened spectrum: (i) An explicit diagonalization of the Weyl function, reduc ing the eigen- value condition to the scalar equations α−µm,B(E) = 0 (see Proposi- tion 6). (ii) A strict monotonicity result (Proposition 12) showing that each angu- lar momentum channel contributes at most oneeigenvalue per spectral gap. (iii) Preciseasymptoticsfortheboundarycoeﬃcients cn,m(Proposition16), establishing faster than exponential decay in |m|, and the correspond- ing asymptotic formula for the eigenvalue shifts (Theorem 1 7). (iv) A semiclassical interpretation (Section 3.6) that lin ks the wall radius with resonant cyclotron modes and explains the mode selecti vity in geometric terms, a viewpoint not available in the abstract t heory. Taken together, these results show that the essential spect rum remains the Landau levels, while for each nthe operator HB,αexhibits an inﬁnite se- quence of discrete eigenvalues that accumulate at Λ nfrom one side only, with the sign of αdetermining whether the accumulation occurs from above or from below. These analytic ﬁndings are consistent with nu merical simu- lations, implemented in Python, which provide an intuitive visualization of the spectral broadening phenomena discussed in this work. 2 Self–adjoint realizations in two dimensions In this section we construct the minimal magnetic operator w ith a circular interface and establish the associated Green’s identity. U sing the bound- ary triple approach we classify all self–adjoint extension s and introduce the penetrable–wall Hamiltonians, which will serve as the basi s for the spectral analysis in the subsequent sections (cf.

Wenotethatinthepresenttwo–dimensional magneticsettin gthebound- ary maps naturally yield a quasiboundary triple in the sense of [6, 19]. 2.1 Comparison with the three–dimensional case We recall the classical three–dimensional model studied by Ikebe and Shi- mada [15], where the Laplacian in R3is coupled to a penetrable spherical 3 wall at radius a>0. The corresponding Hamiltonian is deﬁned by H3D αu=−∆u, D(H3D α) =/braceleftBig u= (u−,u+)∈H2(Ω−)⊕H2(Ω+) : u+|Sa=u−|Sa,[∂ru] =αu|Sa/bracerightBig . whereSa={x∈R3:|x|=a}denotes the sphere (we use the same notation as for the circle in two dimensions), Ω −={x∈R3:|x|<a}is the interior ball, and Ω +={x∈R3:|x|>a}is the exterior domain. Here ∂rdenotes the radial derivative, and α∈Ris the coupling strength. The jump of the radial derivative across the sphere is deﬁned, for u= (u−,u+) with u±∈H2(Ω±), by [∂ru] :=∂ru/vextendsingle/vextendsingle r=a+−∂ru/vextendsingle/vextendsingle r=a−. They proved that the essential spectrum of H3D αis [0,∞), and that discrete eigenvalues may appear below 0 depending on aandα. In particular, in the attractive case α <0 there may exist ﬁnitely many negative eigenvalues, while in the repulsive case α>0 no discrete spectrum occurs (and, in fact, no embedded eigenvalues appear in [0 ,∞)). The occurrence of negative eigenvalues in the attractive case is linked to the radial pa rt of the problem, governed by spherical Bessel functions, at the interface r=a. In contrast, the two–dimensional model studied in the prese nt paper ex- hibits qualitatively diﬀerent behavior. The free Hamiltoni an with magnetic ﬁeldB>0hasspectrumgivenbytheLandaulevels(1.2), each ofwhich isan eigenvalue of inﬁnite multiplicity. Introducing a penetra ble circular wall at Sabreaks this degeneracy, but instead of producing ﬁnitely ma ny isolated eigenvalues, one obtains inﬁnite sequences of eigenvalues accumulating at each Λ n. In other words, each Landau level becomes an accumulation p oint of a one–sided spectral broadening , a phenomenon that has no counterpart in the three–dimensional case. This fundamental diﬀerence stems from the interplay between magnetic quantization and two–dimensional geometry: in 2D the Landa u levels act as highly degenerate accumulation points, and the wall intera ction splits this degeneracy into angular momentum channels, each contribut ing at most one eigenvalue per gap. The accumulation of these eigenvalues a t Λnconstitutes the spectral broadening analyzed in detail in Sections 3–5. 2.2 Preliminaries and the minimal operator LetB >0 and ﬁx a smooth vector potential A:R2→R2with rotA=B. For deﬁniteness we may choose the symmetric gauge A(x) =B 2(−x2,x1), although the following constructions are in fact gauge inva riant. The free 4 magnetic Laplacian is then deﬁned by (1.1), acting in L2(R2) with initial domainC∞ 0(R2). Leta >0 and denote by Sa={x∈R2:|x|=a}the boundary circle. We write Ω −={|x|<a}and Ω+={|x|>a}, with unit normalνpointing from Ω −to Ω+. In order to incorporate the wall, we consider the minimal ope rator with an interface at Sa, Tu:= (−i∇−A)2u,D(T) :=C∞ 0(R2\\Sa)/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblL2+/ba∇dblHB,0·/ba∇dblL2,(2.1) which is closed and symmetric in L2(R2) (see, e.g., [7] for the elliptic oper- ator framework). For u∈H2(Ω+)⊕H2(Ω−) we set the magnetic normal derivatives ∂A νu±:=ν·(∇−iA)u±/vextendsingle/vextendsingle Sa.

The subsequent boundary triple formulation and the Krein’s re- solvent formula we employ below follow the general scheme in [14, 8, 7, 19]; for singular perturbations modeled by δ–type terms we also refer to [1, 2]. 2.3 Boundary operators and self–adjoint extensions Recall the minimal operator Tdeﬁned in (2.1). The boundary operators are now deﬁned on D(T∗) =H2(Ω+)⊕H2(Ω−) by Γ0u:= [∂A νu],Γ1u:=γavu. Then the triple/parenleftbig H1/2(Sa),Γ0,Γ1/parenrightbig forms a quasi boundary triple for T∗(in the sense of the standard theory, see [14, 8, 6]). In particul ar, the abstract Green’s identity (2.2) holds for all u,v∈D(T∗). This framework will serve as the basis for the Krein resolvent formula in the standard f orm (HB,Θ−z)−1= (HB,0−z)−1+γB(z)(Θ−MB(z))−1γB(¯z)∗,(2.3) which we adopt consistently throughout this paper (cf. [8, 1 9, 6]). 5 Deﬁnition 1 (Weyl function) .Forz∈C\\R, we deﬁne the Weyl function by MB(z) :=τ(HB,0−z)−1τ∗, acting from H1/2(Sa) toH−1/2(Sa), whereτdenotes the trace to Sa. This coincides with the abstract Weyl function associated with t he boundary triple/parenleftbig H1/2(Sa),Γ0,Γ1/parenrightbig ; see Proposition 10. The mapping properties of τandτ∗, together with the canonical in- jectionH1/2(Sa)֒→H−1/2(Sa) via theL2(Sa)–pivot, show that the Weyl functionMB(z) acts as a bounded operator H1/2(Sa)→H−1/2(Sa). This is summarized by the following diagram. Here τ:H2(R2)→H3/2(Sa) is the trace map, and its adjoint τ∗:H−3/2(Sa)→H−2(R2). By duality and the Sobolev embeddings H1/2(Sa)֒→H−1/2(Sa)֒→H−3/2(Sa), L2(R2)֒→H−2(R2), τ∗extendscanonicallytoaboundedoperator H−1/2(Sa)→H−2(R2). More- over, since ( HB,0−z) :H2(R2)→L2(R2) is an isomorphismfor z∈C\\R, its inverse extends to a bounded operator ( HB,0−z)−1:H−2(R2)→L2(R2). Thus the composition can be understood diagrammatically as H1/2(Sa)֒→H−1/2(Sa)τ∗ −−→H−2(R2) (HB,0−z)−1 − −−−−−−−− → L2(R2)τ− − →H3/2(Sa)֒→H−1/2(Sa).(2.4) HenceMB(z) indeed maps H1/2(Sa) continuously into H−1/2(Sa). Proposition 1. Let{H1/2(Sa),Γ0,Γ1}be the (quasi) boundary triple ﬁxed above, and let Θ :H1/2(Sa)→H−1/2(Sa)be bounded and self–adjoint. Assume that there exists z0∈C\\Rsuch that Θ−MB(z0)is boundedly invertible on H1/2(Sa). Deﬁne D(HB,Θ) ={u∈D(T∗) : Γ0u= ΘΓ1u}, H B,Θu=T∗u. ThenHB,Θis self–adjoint in L2(R2). Moreover, for every z∈C\\Rsuch thatΘ−MB(z)is invertible, one has the Krein’s resolvent formula (HB,Θ−z)−1= (HB,0−z)−1+γB(z)(Θ−MB(z))−1γB(¯z)∗.(2.5) In particular, (2.3)holds for all z∈ρ(HB,Θ)∩ρ(HB,0). Remark 1.We work within the quasi boundary triple framework; see, e.g ., [6, 8, 19]. Thesign convention in (2.3) correspondsto(Γ 0,Γ1) = ([∂A ν·], γav·) and avoids ambiguities among alternative formulas in the li terature. The assumptionthat Θ −MB(z0) is invertible forsome nonreal z0isstandardand ensures that the extension deﬁned by Γ 0u= ΘΓ1uis closed and self–adjoint inL2(R2). 6 Proposition 2. The deﬁciency indices of Tare inﬁnite. In particular, T is not essentially self–adjoint and admits inﬁnitely many s elf–adjoint exten- sions. Proof.Letz∈C\\Rbe ﬁxed. By the boundary triple construction recalled in Section 2 (see also [14, 8]), for every ϕ∈H−1/2(Sa) there exists a unique γB(z)ϕ∈ker(T∗−z) such that (T∗−z)γB(z)ϕ= 0,Γ0/parenleftbig γB(z)ϕ/parenrightbig =ϕ,",

In particular, Γ 0: ker(T∗−z)→H−1/2(Sa) is onto and ker(T∗−z) = ranγB(z). Since Γ 0◦γB(z) = Id onH−1/2(Sa), the operator γB(z) is injective. Hence dimker(T∗−z) = dimH−1/2(Sa). The spaceH−1/2(Sa) is inﬁnite dimensional, therefore the deﬁciency space ker(T∗−z) is inﬁnite dimensional. Taking z=iandz=−igives that both deﬁciency indices of Tare inﬁnite. In particular, Tis not essentially self–adjoint. Finally, by the quasi boundary triple parametrization of se lf–adjoint ex- tensions (see [8, 7, 6, 19]), if Θ : H1/2(Sa)→H−1/2(Sa) is bounded and self–adjoint and there exists z0∈C\\Rsuch that Θ −MB(z0) is boundedly invertible, thenthe extension deﬁnedbyΓ 0u= ΘΓ1uonSais self–adjoint in L2(R2). Since the boundaryspace is inﬁnitedimensional, there ar e inﬁnitely many such Θ, and hence inﬁnitely many self–adjoint extensio ns. /square Moreover, for z∈C\\R, the map Γ 0: ker(T∗−z)→H−1/2(Sa) is onto, so the Poisson operator γB(z) and the Weyl function MB(z) are well deﬁned. The boundary triple formalism yields a complete par ametrization of self-adjoint extensions: for any bounded self-adjoint Θ :H1/2(Sa)→ H−1/2(Sa), the operator HB,Θdeﬁned by Γ 0u= ΘΓ1uonSais self-adjoint. Furthermore, MBis a Herglotz (Nevanlinna) function: MB(z)−MB(¯z)∗ z−¯z=γB(¯z)∗γB(z)≥0, z∈C\\R, that is,MB(¯z) =MB(z)∗and, for Im z>0, ImMB(z) =1 2i/parenleftbig MB(z)−MB(z)∗/parenrightbig ≥0 onH1/2(Sa). 7 2.4 Penetrable–wall Hamiltonians and gauge covariance We write Mαfor the multiplication operator by αto avoid confusion with the Weyl function MB(z), and recall from (2.6) that Mαacts as a bounded operatorH1/2(Sa)→H−1/2(Sa) deﬁned by /a\\}b∇acketle{tMαφ,ψ/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH−1/2,H1/2=/integraldisplay Saαφψdσ (φ,ψ∈H1/2(Sa)),(2.6) wheredσdenotesthesurfacemeasureon Sa. Inthefollowingweshallsimply writeαin place of Mαwhen no confusion can arise, since from Section 3 onwardsαis always a constant. In this case the corresponding self–ad joint extension will be denoted HB,α. Its domain can be described explicitly as D(HB,α) =/braceleftBig u= (u−,u+)∈H2(Ω−)⊕H2(Ω+) : γ+u=γ−u=:γu,[∂A νu] =αγuonSa/bracerightBig .(2.7) and on this domain the operator acts as HB,αu= (HB,0u−,HB,0u+). Since Mαis real and self–adjoint, the operator HB,αis self–adjoint in L2(R2). We note that the construction is invariant under gauge trans formations. IfA′=A+∇χwithχsmooth and real–valued, then the unitary oper- atorUχu=eiχusatisﬁesUχHB,αU−1 χ=HB,α, while the boundary maps transform covariantly (see, e.g., [17, Sec. 15] for gauge co variance in the Schr¨ odinger setting). Indeed, for Uχu=eiχuone has [∂A+∇χ ν(Uχu)] =eiχ[∂A νu], γ av(Uχu) =eiχγavu, so the boundary condition [ ∂A νu] =αγavuis preserved. Thus the class of penetrable–wall Hamiltonians and their spectral properti es do not depend on the particular choice of gauge. More generally, the above construction is valid for a smooth magnetic potentialAand for variable wall strength α∈L∞(Sa;R). In this setting the Green’s identity, the deﬁnition of the boundary maps, an d the Krein’s resolvent formula remain valid [14, 8, 7, 19], and the extens ionHB,αdeﬁned by the boundary condition [ ∂A νu] =Mαγavuis self–adjoint in L2(R2).

Inthefollowingsectionsweshallrestrictourselvestothe caseofacircular wallSawith constant coupling α∈R, which permits an explicit diagonal- ization of the Weyl function. 8 3 Landau levels broadened by a penetrable–wall In this section we analyze how a penetrable–wall modiﬁes the spectral pic- ture of the Landau Hamiltonian. We ﬁrst examine the behavior of negative eigenvalues in the regime of small magnetic ﬁelds, which pro vides the bridge to the non-magnetic case H0,α. We then prove that the essential spectrum is preserved for all B >0, while the inﬁnite multiplicity of each Landau level is destroyed and replaced by sequences of discrete eigenval ues converging to theaccumulation points. Thesubsequentmodedecompositio n andsemiclas- sical interpretation clarify the detailed structure of the broadened spectrum (see also the general perturbative picture near Landau accu mulation points in [20, 18, 9]). 3.1 Persistence of the essential spectrum We begin by recalling the unperturbed picture. For a constan t magnetic ﬁeldB >0, the spectrum of the free magnetic Laplacian HB,0consists only of the Landau levels Λ n=B(2n+ 1), each of which is an eigenvalue of inﬁnite multiplicity. Onceapenetrable–wall is introduced along Sa, theHamiltonian becomes HB,αwith domain given in (2.7). Since the perturbation is suppor ted on a compact curve, it is relatively compact with respect to HB,0, and hence the essential spectrum remains unchanged by Weyl’s theorem. Proposition 3. For everyα∈L∞(Sa;R)the essential spectrum of HB,α coincides with that of the free operator: σess(HB,α) ={Λn:n∈N0}. Proof.Fix a nonreal z∈C\\{Λn:n∈N0}. By Krein’s resolvent formula (2.3) from Section 2 (see [8, 19] for the abstract form) one ha s (HB,α−z)−1−(HB,0−z)−1 =γB(z)(Mα−MB(z))−1γB(¯z)∗. (3.1) HereγB(z) :H−1/2(Sa)→L2(R2)isthePoissonoperator, MB(z) :H1/2(Sa)→ H−1/2(Sa) is the Weyl function, and Mα:H1/2(Sa)→H−1/2(Sa) is the multiplication operator by α∈L∞(Sa;R), given explicitly in (2.6). For ﬁxed nonreal z, the operator ( Mα−MB(z))−1is bounded by the general boundary triple theory. We claim that γB(¯z)∗:L2(R2)→H1/2(Sa) is compact. Let χ∈C∞ c(R2) be a cutoﬀ that equals 1 in a neighborhood of Sa. By elliptic regularity for magnetic Schr¨ odinger operators with smooth A, the resolvent ( HB,0−¯z)−1 mapsL2(R2) boundedly into H2 loc(R2). Hence, for any bounded domain Ω containingSa, one has (HB,0−¯z)−1:L2(R2)−→H2(Ω). 9 The trace theorem for smooth boundaries then yields a bounde d map H2(Ω)Tr−−→H3/2(Sa). SinceSais a compact 1–dimensional manifold, the Rellich–Kondrach ov the- orem ensures that H3/2(Sa)֒→H1/2(Sa) is a compact embedding. This is a standard Sobolev result; se e, for in- stance, [23, Ch. 4] or classical references on Sobolev space s. Therefore the composition L2(R2)(HB,0−¯z)−1 −−−−−−−→ H2(Ω)Tr−−→H3/2(Sa)֒→H1/2(Sa) is compact, showing that γB(¯z)∗is compact. Consequently, the right–hand side of (3.1) is a composition of bounded operators with the compact operator γB(¯z)∗, hence it is compact on L2(R2).",

Therefore the composition L2(R2)(HB,0−¯z)−1 −−−−−−−→ H2(Ω)Tr−−→H3/2(Sa)֒→H1/2(Sa) is compact, showing that γB(¯z)∗is compact. Consequently, the right–hand side of (3.1) is a composition of bounded operators with the compact operator γB(¯z)∗, hence it is compact on L2(R2). By Weyl’s theorem, compact perturbations do not change the e ssential spec- trum. Since σess(HB,0) ={Λn:n∈N0}, we conclude that σess(HB,α) =σess(HB,0) ={Λn:n∈N0}. In particular, the Landau levels remain ﬁxed as essential sp ectral points. /square 3.2 Behavior ofnegative eigenvalues for small magnetic ﬁel ds We now discuss how the negative discrete spectrum of HB,αbehaves when a weak magnetic ﬁeld B >0 is present. For α <0 the operator H0,α has ﬁnitely many negative eigenvalues below 0 (cf. [15, 1, 2] ), which are separated from the essential spectrum [0 ,∞). Our aim here is to show that these eigenvalues persist for small B, vary analytically with respect to B, and approach their non–magnetic counterparts as B→0. The negative eigenvalues of H0,αremain well below the lowest accumu- lation point Λ 0=Bfor smallB, and hence persist as isolated eigenvalues ofHB,α. More precisely, Kato’s perturbation theory for analytic f amilies of type (B) (see Kato [16, Chap. VII, Section 3.5]) ensures th at every sim- ple eigenvalue Ej(0)<0 ofH0,αgenerates an analytic eigenvalue branch Ej(B) ofHB,αwithEj(B)→Ej(0) asB→0. Indeed, with form domain domqB,α=H1(R2) the closed, lower–bounded quadratic form qB,α[u] :=/ba∇dbl(∇−iAB)u/ba∇dbl2 L2(R2)+α/ba∇dblγu/ba∇dbl2 L2(Sa), A B(x) =B 2(−x2,x1), depends analytically on B. Hence {HB,α}B≥0is an analytic family of type (B) in the sense of Kato [16, Chap. VII, Section 3.5]. 10 Moreover, by time-reversal symmetry the spectrum is invari ant under B/ma√sto→ −B, so the eigenvalue branches Ej(B) are even functions of Band the linear term in the expansion vanishes. The diamagnetic i nequality [21, Eq. (1.1), Chap. 1] implies Ej(B)≥Ej(0), hence the quadratic coeﬃcient is nonnegative. Therefore Ej(B) =Ej(0)+cjB2+o(B2), c j≥0. Thus the magnetic ﬁeld has a stabilizing (non–lowering) eﬀec t on the negative eigenvalues, in the sense that they may shift upwar ds but cannot cross below their B= 0 positions. Since the lowest Landau level Λ 0=B tends to zero linearly in B, the gap between the negative eigenvalues and the essential spectrum remains open for suﬃciently small B. In summary, the negative spectrum of HB,αfor smallBis a perturba- tion of that of H0,α: the discrete eigenvalues survive, vary analytically with B, and approach their nonmagnetic counterparts as B→0. This behav- ior contrasts sharply with the spectral broadening near the Landau levels described in Sections 3–5, which have no analogue at B= 0. 3.3 Spectral broadening and direction of accumulation AlthoughtheLandaulevelsremainasessentialspectralacc umulation points, the penetrable–wall produces new families of discrete eige nvalues.

[20, 18, 9]) and, for δ–type interactions supported on curves, have been analyzed rigorously in [3, 4, 5]. Lemma 4 (Existence and uniqueness of mode solutions) .Fixm∈Zand n∈N0. Then the scalar equation α−µm,B(E) = 0, E∈(Λn,Λn+1), (3.2) has at most one solution. Moreover, if αlies strictly between the boundary valueslimE↓Λnµm,B(E)andlimE↑Λn+1µm,B(E), then such a solution exists. Proof.ByProposition12, µm,B(E)isstrictlymonotoneoneachgap(Λ n,Λn+1). AsE↓Λnone hasµm,B(E)→ −∞, while asE↑Λn+1one hasµm,B(E)→ +∞. Henceµm,B(E) covers the entire real line, and by the intermediate value theorem the scalar equation admits a unique solution w heneverαlies between the endpoint values. /square Remark3.Atspecialradii awherecn+1,m= 0(equivalently, when L(|m|) n+1(B 2a2) = 0), the pole at Λ n+1disappears and µm,B(E) remains ﬁnite as E↑Λn+1. In this exceptional case µm,B(E) ranges only over a half–line, so the existence of a solution depends on the sign of α. 11 Theorem 5. Assume that the wall is the circle Saandα∈R\\{0}. Then for everyn∈N0there exists an inﬁnite sequence of eigenvalues of HB,α, obtained as solutions of the eigenvalue equations of Lemma 4 , accumulating atΛn. The accumulation is one–sided: if α <0the eigenvalues approach Λnfrom above, while if α>0they approach from below. Proof.By Lemma 4, for each m∈Zthe eigenvalue equation corresponding to theboundarycondition in (2.7) has either nosolution or a uniquesolution in (Λn,Λn+1). From the expansion µm,B(E) =cn,m Λn−E+hn,m(E), withcn,mdeﬁned in (5.1), cn,m>0, andcn,m→0 as|m| → ∞, it follows that for large |m|a solution exists with En,m−Λn=−cn,m α+o(cn,m). Thus inﬁnitely many mcontribute solutions converging to Λ n, and the sign of the shift shows that the accumulation is from above for α<0 and from below forα>0. In particular, the eigenvalues originate from the upper g ap (Λn,Λn+1) whenα<0, and from the lower gap (Λ n−1,Λn) whenα>0./square Remark4.Althoughtheinﬁnitedegeneracy ofΛ nasaneigenvalue of HB,0is destroyed when α/\\e}atio\\slash= 0, the point Λ nitself remains in the essential spectrum ofHB,α. This is not contradictory: theLandau levels cease to beeig envalues of inﬁnite multiplicity and instead become accumulation po ints of inﬁnitely many discrete eigenvalues of ﬁnite multiplicity. Moreover , in the attractive caseα<0 the eigenvalues approach each Landau level from above, whe reas forα >0 no negative eigenvalues occur below Λ 0=B, and the broadened spectrum in each gap approaches Λ nfrom below. Thus, the inﬁnitely degenerate eigenvalue Λ nis replaced by a broad- ened spectrum lying in the neighboring gap. In other words, t he inﬁnitely degenerate point at Λ nis replaced by a countable family of eigenvalues ac- cumulating at Λ n, so that a whole sequence of discrete energies condenses towards the Landau level. 3.4 Mode decomposition in the circular case When the wall is circular, Sa, and the coupling αis constant, the system enjoys rotational symmetry. This allows for a decompositio n into angular momentum channels. Writing the Fourier basis {eimθ}m∈ZonSa, the Weyl function diagonalizes as MB(z)eimθ=µm,B(z)eimθ, 12 in accordance with the general boundary triple scheme and th e special– function representation of Landau eigenfunctions (see [14 , 8, 7] and, for explicit formulas, [10]).",

Writing the Fourier basis {eimθ}m∈ZonSa, the Weyl function diagonalizes as MB(z)eimθ=µm,B(z)eimθ, 12 in accordance with the general boundary triple scheme and th e special– function representation of Landau eigenfunctions (see [14 , 8, 7] and, for explicit formulas, [10]). Proposition 6. For eachm∈Zthe eigenvalue condition reduces to the scalar equation α−µm,B(E) = 0, E∈R\\{Λn}. This equation admits at most one solution in each spectral gap . Collectively over allm, these solutions constitute the spectral broadening attac hed toΛn. Proof.WithintheboundarytripleframeworkﬁxedinSection2(see[ 14,8,7] for the abstract reduction and [19] for Krein-type formulas ), we obtain the following characterization. Forz∈C\\ {Λn:n∈N0}one has ker( T∗−z)/\\e}atio\\slash={0}and the Weyl functionMB(z) is well deﬁned on H1/2(Sa). In particular, for real energies E∈R\\{Λn}one may evaluate MB(E) by restriction. By the abstract eigenvalue characterization for boundary t riples,Eis an eigenvalue of HB,αif and only if there exists φ∈H1/2(Sa)\\{0}such that (Mα−MB(E))φ= 0, whereMαis the multiplication by the constant αonH1/2(Sa) (cf. [14, 8]). In the circular case Sa, the operator MB(z) is diagonal in the Fourier basis {eimθ}m∈ZofL2(Sa), that is MB(z)eimθ=µm,B(z)eimθ, m∈Z, with scalar coeﬃcients µm,B(z). In particular, for real energies E∈R\\{Λn} one obtains MB(E)eimθ=µm,B(E)eimθ. SinceMαcommutes with MB(E) and, by (2.6), acts as Mαeimθ=αeimθ, the eigenvalue condition reduces mode–wise to (α−µm,B(E))cm= 0 (m∈Z), wherecmare the Fourier coeﬃcients of φ=/summationtext m∈Zcmeimθ. Hence a nontrivial solution φexists if and only if there is an index m such that α−µm,B(E) = 0, which proves the stated scalar reduction. It remains to show that there is at most one solution per gap. F ix m∈Z. By Proposition 12 the map E/ma√sto→µm,B(E) is strictly monotone on every open interval (Λ n,Λn+1) (see also the general spectral monotonicity mechanisms for Landau-type operators in [20, 18]). Therefo re the equation 13 α−µm,B(E) = 0 has at most one root in each gap. Since the full eigen- function space is the orthogonal sum of the angular momentum channels, the discrete spectrum created by the wall is obtained by coll ecting, over allm∈Z, the (gapwise unique, when present) solutions of these scal ar equations. These eigenvalues, taken together as mvaries, form the cluster converging to Λ ndescribed in Section 3. /square From this perspective, the degeneracy of the Landau level is broken into angular momentum sectors, and each sector contributes its o wn discrete eigenvalue. The location of the eigenvalue depends sensiti vely on the mode numbermand on the radius aof the wall. Hence the distribution of eigen- values in the broadened spectrum reﬂects the interplay betw een cyclotron motion and the geometry of the boundary. To illustrate Proposition 6, we present in Figure 1 a numeric al compu- tation of the eigenvalues in the ﬁrst spectral gap (Λ 0,Λ1) forB= 1.0 and a= 1.1.

Dashed lines mark Λ 0,Λ1. Remark 5 (Numerical remarks) .The eigenvalues displayed in Figures 1– 3 were obtained by solving the scalar equation α−µm,B(E) = 0 with a standard bracketing root ﬁnder. The strict monotonicity of µm,Bon each spectral gap (Proposition 12) guarantees uniquenessand st ability of theroot 14 when it exists. The series representation of µm,Bwas truncated according to the factorial/Laguerre estimates in Section 5, and converg ence was checked by increasing the cutoﬀs. Only values stable under these chec ks are shown in the ﬁgures. To further illustrate the eﬀect of the penetrable–wall, Figu re 2 compares the spatial proﬁles of the eigenfunctions in the free case ( α= 0) and in the wall case (α=−3), forB= 1,a=√ 3, and angular momentum m= 1. Bothplots are L2–normalized andsharethesamecolor scale. Inthefreecase the Landau state is smoothly extended with a radial node near r= 2, while in the presence of the attractive wall the wave function deve lops a clear localization around the boundary r=a. This visualization is consistent with the analytic conclusion that the wall interaction dest roys the inﬁnite degeneracy and creates localized eigenvalues accumulatin g at the Landau accumulation points. −4 −2 0 2 4 x 1−4−2024x 2Free: E = 3 ( n = 1, m = 1) r = a −4 −2 0 2 4 x 1Wall: E ≈ 2.995 9 ( α = − 3.0, m = 1) r = a 0.00000.00350.00700.01050.01400.01750.02100.02450.02800.0315 |u (x , y )|2 Figure 2: Free ( α= 0) vs. wall ( α=−3), withB= 1,a=√ 3,m= 1; both L2-normalized, same color scale.

Nevertheless, at certain discrete values of the radius a, remnants of the degeneracy can survive. Lemma 7. Fixn≥1. (i) For each m∈Z, the equation L(|m|) n(x) = 0has only ﬁnitely many positive solutions x >0(hence the zero set in xis discrete). Con- sequently, the set of radii a >0such thatL(|m|) n/parenleftbigB 2a2/parenrightbig = 0is ﬁnite (hence discrete). (ii) Ifk≥1and the condition in (i) holds for both m=kandm= −k, then the corresponding Landau eigenfunctions ψn,kandψn,−kare 15 linearly independent. Thus each such zero contributes multi plicity at most two to the eigenspace (for k= 0the contribution is at most one). Proof of Lemma 7. (i) Fixm∈Z.

    "15 linearly independent. Thus each such zero contributes multi plicity at most two to the eigenspace (for k= 0the contribution is at most one). Proof of Lemma 7. (i) Fixm∈Z. The generalized Laguerre polynomial L(|m|) n(x) is a polynomial in xof degreen. Hence it has at most nreal zeros, in particular only ﬁnitely many positive zeros x>0. Therefore the zero set inxis discrete. Since x=B 2a2is a strictly increasing C∞–bijection from a>0 ontox>0, the set of radii a>0 withL(|m|) n/parenleftbigB 2a2/parenrightbig = 0 is also discrete (indeed, ﬁnite, with cardinality ≤n). (ii) Letk≥1 and suppose there exists x >0 such that L(k) n(x) = 0 (equivalently, the condition in (i) holds for both m=kandm=−k). Then the corresponding Landau eigenfunctions ψn,kandψn,−kare linearly independent. For k= 0 there is only one mode, so the contribution is at most one. Thus each such zero contributes multiplicity at mo st two to the eigenspace. /square Lemma 8. Fixn≥1andx >0. Then the set {m∈N0:L(m) n(x) = 0} has cardinality at most n. Proof.Using the ﬁnite expansion (see, e.g., standard formulas for general- ized Laguerre polynomials), L(m) n(x) =n/summationdisplay j=0(−1)j j!/parenleftbiggn+m n−j/parenrightbigg xj, and ﬁxx >0. For each j, the binomial coeﬃcient/parenleftbign+m n−j/parenrightbig is a polynomial inmof degreen−jwith leading term mn−j/(n−j)!. HenceL(m) n(x) is a polynomial in mofexactdegreen; indeed, the coeﬃcient of mncomes solely from j= 0 and equals 1 /n!>0, so the polynomial is not identically zero. Therefore it can have at most nreal zeros, and in particular at most nintegersm≥0 satisfyL(m) n(x) = 0. /square Proposition 9. Forn= 0andα/\\e}atio\\slash= 0one has ker(HB,α−Λ0) ={0}. Forn≥1there exists a discrete set of radii asuch that ker(HB,α−Λn)is nontrivial, with dimension not exceeding 2n. Proof.We adopt the symmetric gauge A(x) =B 2(−x2,x1), for which the radial component vanishes on Sa(Ar≡0). Hence the magnetic normal derivative coincides with the ordinary radial derivative o nSa, i.e.,∂A ν=∂r. We ﬁrst consider the lowest Landau level n= 0. In the symmetric gauge one has ψ0,m(r,θ) =C0,mr|m|e−B 4r2eimθ, so thatL(|m|) 0/parenleftbigB 2r2/parenrightbig ≡1. Hence ψ0,m(a,θ) =C0,ma|m|e−B 4a2eimθ/\\e}atio\\slash= 0 for all m∈Z. 16 Ifu∈ker(HB,α−Λ0), then away from Sait solves (HB,0−Λ0)u= 0, sou is a linear combination of lowest Landau eigenfunctions on e ach side of Sa. The penetrable–wall boundary condition, as in (2.7), is [ ∂A νu] =α,γuonSa. Sinceψ0,m(a,θ)/\\e}atio\\slash= 0 for allm, the right–hand side αγucan vanish only ifγu= 0, which forces u|Sa≡0. Unique continuation then implies u≡0. Therefore ker( HB,α−Λ0) ={0}. Now letn≥1. IfL(|m|) n/parenleftbigB 2a2/parenrightbig = 0, thenψn,mvanishes identically on Sa and thus belongs to ker( HB,α−Λn). By Lemma 7(i), the set of such radii a is discrete. Moreover, Lemma 8 shows that for ﬁxed nthere are at most n indicesm≥0 for which the condition can be satisﬁed. Taking into accoun t the symmetry m/ma√sto→ −mand Lemma 7(ii), each such index contributes at most two independent eigenfunctions ψn,±m, so the multiplicity of the eigenspace does not exceed 2 n. /square Thus, embedded eigenvalues at the Landau accumulation poin ts may persist, but only in a highly nongeneric manner and with stri ctly limited multiplicity. 3.6 Semiclassical picture of mode resonance For intuition, we compare this",

For an electron in the n–th Landau level, the cyclotron radius is given by rc(n)≈√ 2n+1ℓB, (3.3) whereℓB= 1/√ Bdenotes the magnetic length (see, e.g., [17]). This ap- proximation reﬂects the classical orbit size associated wi th then–th Landau state. In the mode decomposition, the m–th angular momentum channel of a Landau eigenfunction has its radial probability concentr ated nearr≈/radicalbig 2m/B. Thus when the wall radius ais close torc(n) in (3.3), there exists a mode index m∗≈a2 2ℓ2 B−/parenleftbigg n+1 2/parenrightbigg , whose cyclotron orbit is resonant with the wall position. Fo r thism∗–mode, the boundary interaction acts most strongly, so that the ass ociated eigen- valueEn,m∗deviates from Λ nmoresigniﬁcantly than for neighboringmodes. Consequently, the point En,m∗appears as the most prominent element in the cluster of eigenvalues condensing at Λ n. As the wall radius avaries, the resonant index m∗changes, and the “leading” eigenvalue in the cluster jumps from one mode to an other. This semiclassical resonance mechanism explains how the wall ge ometry governs the ﬁne structure of the broadened spectrum. We stress that t he word “resonance” here is used in a heuristic sense, referring to t he geometric 17 matching between the wall and the cyclotron orbit, not to res onances in the spectral or scattering theoretic sense. See also the gen eral perturbative picture near Landau accumulation points in [20, 18, 9].

One observes that the m= 3 mode reaches its maximum almost exactly at the wall, while the m= 4 mode peaks slightly outside. These neighboring modes the refore have the largest overlap with the boundary, so the wall interacti on aﬀects them most strongly.

In order to make the analysis concrete it is convenient to wri te down an explicit expression for the diagonal entries of the Weyl fun ction. We take the symmetric gauge A(x) =B 2(−x2,x1), in which the Landau eigenfunc- tions are well known (see e.g., [17]). For integers m∈Zandn∈N0, an orthonormal basis of the eigenspace ker( HB,0−Λn)",

We consider the boundary operator KB(z) :=τRB(z)τ∗onL2(Sa). By Proposition 10 we identify KB(z) with the Weyl function MB(z) : H1/2(Sa)→H−1/2(Sa) in the sense that /a\\}b∇acketle{tMB(z)ϕ,ψ/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH−1/2,H1/2=/a\\}b∇acketle{tKB(z)ϕ,ψ/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htL2(Sa)(ϕ,ψ∈H1/2(Sa)). Accordingly, it suﬃces to diagonalize KB(z) onL2(Sa) and then read oﬀ the diagonal of MB(z). In the present setting KB(z) agrees with the Weyl functionMB(z), since the Poisson solution operator and the jump map are related toRB(z) by Green’s identity (2.2) and the choice of boundary maps. Thus it is enough to compute KB(z). The free Hamiltonian HB,0is invariant under planar rotations about the origin, and the same is true for τandτ∗. HenceKB(z) commutes with the unitary representation of the rotation group on L2(Sa). The irreducible subspaces of this representation are the one–dimensional s paces spanned by eimθ,m∈Z. It follows that KB(z) is diagonal in the basis {eimθ}m∈Zand acts as a scalar on each mode. Therefore there exist numbers µm,B(z) such that KB(z)eimθ=µm,B(z)eimθ, m∈Z.

This proves the stated formulas. /square Remark 6.The normalization constants can be chosen as |Cn,m|2=B|m|+1n! 2|m|+1π(n+|m|)!, and hence the coeﬃcients µm,B(z) admit a completely explicit representa- tion. 21 Proposition 12 (Monotonicity of the diagonal coeﬃcients) .For each ﬁxed m∈Z, the function E/ma√sto→µm,B(E)is strictly monotone on every open interval(Λn,Λn+1). It follows that the eigenvalue equation α−µm,B(E) = 0 has at most one solution in each spectral gap for every angula r momentum mode. Thus each mode contributes at most one discrete eigenva lue, and the entire spectral broadening attached to a Landau level is obt ained by collecting these contributions over all integers m. Proof.LetRB(z) = (HB,0−z)−1forz∈C\\ {Λn:n∈N0}and letτ denote the trace to Sa. By Proposition 10, the Weyl function MB(z) may be identiﬁed with KB(z) =τRB(z)τ∗onL2(Sa). As noted in (2.4), one has MB(z) =τRB(z)τ∗, µ m,B(z) =/a\\}b∇acketle{teimθ, MB(z)eimθ/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htL2(Sa). Fixm∈Zand letE∈(Λn,Λn+1). SinceEbelongs to the resolvent set ofHB,0, the mapz/ma√sto→MB(z) is analytic near E, and the resolvent identity gives d dERB(E) = (HB,0−E)−2. Diﬀerentiating µm,B(E) =/a\\}b∇acketle{teimθ, τRB(E)τ∗eimθ/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htyields d dEµm,B(E) =/angbracketleftBig eimθ, τ(HB,0−E)−2τ∗eimθ/angbracketrightBig L2(Sa) =/angbracketleftBig (HB,0−E)−1τ∗eimθ,(HB,0−E)−1τ∗eimθ/angbracketrightBig L2(R2) =/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble(HB,0−E)−1τ∗eimθ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2 L2(R2). (4.5) Here we used that (cf. (2.4)) τ(HB,0−E)−2τ∗=/parenleftbig (HB,0−E)−1τ∗/parenrightbig∗/parenleftbig (HB,0−E)−1τ∗/parenrightbig , which is a positive operator on L2(Sa). Therefore the right–hand side of (4.5) is nonnegative for all Ein the open gaps (Λ n,Λn+1). In fact it is strictly positive: indeed, τ∗eimθ/\\e}atio\\slash= 0 inL2(R2) (sinceeimθis a nontrivial boundary function), and the free resolvent ( HB,0−E)−1is injective on L2(R2) whenever E /∈ {Λn:n∈N0}. Hence the norm in (4.5) cannot vanish, and E/ma√sto→µm,B(E) is strictly increasing on every open spectral gap. It follows that for each ﬁxed α∈Rthe function E/ma√sto→α−µm,B(E) is strictly monotone on every gap, so the equation α−µm,B(E) = 0 admits at most one solution there. /square 22 5 Asymptotic behavior of boundary coeﬃcients In this section we investigate the asymptotic behavior of th e boundary co- eﬃcients for large |m|, which provides the basis for the precise evaluation of the eigenvalue shifts.

The one–sided bound follows from the two–sided Stirling est imates by ab- sorbingconstants into K1(see, e.g., [10, Chap.1] for a convenient reference). /square Lemma 14. Fixn∈N0andx>0. Ask→ ∞, L(k) n(x) =/parenleftbiggn+k n/parenrightbigg/parenleftBig 1−x k+O(k−2)/parenrightBig .

Moreover, the convergence is uniform: for every ε >0there existsM(ε)such that |hn,m(Λn)|<εwhenever |m| ≥M(ε). Proof.Since|Λk−Λn|= 2B|k−n|, we have |hn,m(Λn)| ≤1 2B/summationdisplay k/negationslash=nck,m |k−n|.

For the ﬁnite head, each ﬁxed ksatisﬁesck,m→0 as|m| → ∞(by Propo- sition 16,ck,mdecays faster than any exponential in |m|), hence the head tendsto0as |m| → ∞. Forthetail, standardkernelandgenerating–function estimates for generalized Laguerre polynomials, together with the explicit normalization (cf. Remark 6), yield a constant C=C(a,B)>0 such that /summationdisplay k≥0ck,m≤Cfor allm∈Z.

[22]) to deduce such a bound uniformly in m. Thus the tail is bounded byC/(2BJ). First choose Jlarge to make the tail <ε/2, then choose |m| large so that the head <ε/2. This proves the claim. /square Proposition 16. Fixn∈N0,a >0,B >0. Setx=B 2a2.

In particular, cn,mdecays faster than any exponential in |m|. (That is, for every β >0one hascn,m=O(e−β|m|) as|m| → ∞.) Proof.Combining the deﬁning formula (5.1) for cn,mwith the expression for/ba∇dblψn,m(a,·)/ba∇dbl2 L2(Sa)in (4.3) and the estimates of the previous two lemmas gives cn,m= 2πa|Cn,m|2a2|m|e−B 2a2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleL(|m|) n(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 ∼/parenleftBig 2πae−B 2a2/parenrightBigB|m|+1n! 2|m|+1π(n+|m|)!a2|m|/parenleftbiggn+|m| n/parenrightbigg2 =Kn(a,B)1 (n+|m|)!/parenleftBigBa2 2/parenrightBig|m|/parenleftbiggn+|m| n/parenrightbigg2 , (5.2) withKn(a,B) =n!Be−B 2a2/2. Finally, using/parenleftbign+|m| n/parenrightbig ∼(n+|m|)n/n! for ﬁxednand Stirling’s formula for ( n+|m|)!, we obtain the stated faster than any exponential decay (see also [10, Chap. 10]). /square Theorem 17. Letn∈N0andα∈R. For the eigenvalues En,msolving α−µm,B(E) = 0in a neighborhood of Λn, withcn,mdeﬁned in (5.1), one has En,m−Λn=−cn,m α+o(cn,m) (|m| → ∞). In particular, the shifts En,m−Λnare negative for α >0and positive for α<0, hence always approach Λnfrom the side predicted in Theorem 5.

Sincecn,m→0 faster than any exponential in |m|by Proposition 16, for |m|large we may assume|hn,m(Λn)| ≤ |α|/4 and|rn,m(δ)| ≤ |α|/4 at the (unique small) solutionδ. Solving for δyields δ=cn,m hn,m(Λn)+rn,m(δ)−α=−cn,m α/parenleftbig 1+o(1)/parenrightbig (|m| → ∞), and hence En,m−Λn=−cn,m α+o(cn,m). The sign statement follows immediately. /square 25 Appendix: Numerical methods The numerical plots in Figures 1–3 were obtained from the sca lar eigenvalue condition (3.2) using the following standard procedures. (i)Series truncation. The series representation of µm,B(z) in (4.1) was truncated at n≤Nmax, chosen so that the last term was smaller than 10−12in absolute value. Increasing Nmaxdid not change the displayed digits of the results. (ii)Root ﬁnding. For each angular momentum index m, the equation was solved in the relevant gap (Λ n,Λn+1) by the Brent method, start- ing from an interval bracketing the root. The strict monoton icity of µm,B(E) (Proposition 12) guarantees uniqueness in each gap, so a si m- ple bracketing suﬃces. (iii)Accuracy. Solutions are stable under reﬁnement of the truncation and bracketing. Relative errors are estimated to be less than 10−8. Theﬁgureswereproducedwithstandardnumericalsoftware( Python/SciPy). Thecomputations are straightforward and can bereproduced with any com- parable package. References [1] S. Albeverio, F. Gesztesy, R. Høegh-Krohn, and H.
