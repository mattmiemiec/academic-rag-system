We prove that an infinite compact spaceX is scattered if and only if every closed infinite-dimensional subspace inC p(X) contains a copy ofc 0(with the pointwise topology) which is complemented in the whole spaceC p(X). This provides aC p- version of the theorem of Lotz, Peck and Porta for Banach spaces C(X) andc 0. Applications will be provided. We prove also a Cp-version of Rosenthal’s theorem by showing that for an infinite compactXthe spaceC p(X) contains a closed copy ofc 0(Γ) (with the pointwise topology) for some uncountable set Γ if and only ifX admits an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint open subsets of X. Illustrating examples, additional supplementingC p-theorems and comments are included. 1.Introduction For a locally convex space (lcs)EbyE′we denote its topological dual, especiallyE′ β= (E′, β(E′, E)) means the strong dual ofE. For a Tychonoff spaceXbyC p(X) we denote the spaceC(X) of continuous real valued functions onXendowed with the pointwise topology. By c0we denote the classical Banach space of real sequencesx= (x n) converging to zero with the sup-norm topology. In 1958 Pe lczy´ nski and Semadeni [23, Main Therorem] proved a re- markable theorem gathering several equivalent conditions characteriz- ing scattered compact spaces. Among the others they showed that a compact spaceXis scattered if and only if every closed infinite- dimensional closed subspace ofC(X) contains an isomorphic copy of the Banach sequence spacec 0. In [20, Theorem 11] Lotz, Peck and Porta extended this theorem, see also [21] for several concrete exam- ples semi-embeddings between Banach spaces. 2010Mathematics Subject Classification.54C35, 54G12, 54H05, 46A03.

(2)Any closed infinite-dimensional vector subspace of the Banach spaceC(X)contains a copy of the Banach spacec 0which is complemented inC(X). (3)Any semi-embedding fromC(X)into a Banach space is embed- ding. (4)IfEis a Banach space andT:C(X)→Eis an injective linear continuous map which is not an embedding, then there is a complemented subspaceGofC(X)such thatGis isomorphic toc 0andT|Gis compact. The term semi-embedding denotes an injective continuous linear map from one Banach space into another, which maps the closed unit ball of the domain onto a closed set. An embedding of a Banach space into another is a continuous linear map which is an isomorphism onto a closed subspace of its codomain.

If additionallyTis injective, we say thatTissemi-embedding. In [9, Theorem 6] we proved another alternative characterization of compact scattered spaces as follows: Theorem 2(K¸ akol–Kurka).LetXbe an infinite compact space. The following assertions are equivalent: (1)Xis scattered. (2)There is no infinite-dimensional closedσ-compact vector sub- space ofC p(X). (3)There is no infinite-dimensional vector subspaceFofC p(X) admitting a fundamental sequence of bounded sets. In the paper we show the followingC p-variant of Theorem 1 which will also provide a more comprehensive look at the Lotz, Peck and Porta result. Theorem 3.For an infinite compact spaceXthe following assertions are equivalent: (1)Xis scattered. (2)Every closed infinite-dimensional vector subspace ofC p(X)con- tains a copy of(c 0)pwhich is complemented in the spaceC p(X), where(c 0)p={(x n)∈RN:xn→0}is endowed with the topol- ogy ofRN. Note (c 0)p≈C p(S), whereS={n−1:n∈N} ∪ {0}. LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 3 Remark4.IfXis infinite compact and scattered, our Theorem 3 pro- vides a fulfilling perspective on the Lotz, Peck, Porta theorem. Indeed, ifEis any infinite-dimensional closed vector subspace ofC(X), Theo- rem 3 and the classical closed graph theorem yield thatEcontains not only a copy of the Banach spacec 0complemented in the Banach space C(X) (with a continuous projection, sayT:C(X)→c 0) but simulta- neously contains a copy of the space (c 0)pcomplemented inC p(X) with the same continuous projectionT:C p(X)→(c 0)p, see Proposition 18. On the other hand, we prove also the followingC p-version of Rosen- thal’s [25, Theorem 4.5]. Theorem 5.For a compact spaceXthe following are equivalent. (1)There exists an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint open subsets ofX. (2)C p(X)contains a copy of(c 00(Γ)) pfor some uncountable setΓ. (3)C p(X)contains a closed copy of(c 0(Γ)) pfor some uncountable setΓ. (4)C(X)contains a copy ofc 0(Γ)for some uncountable setΓ. (5)C p(X)contains a compact non-separable subset. Last Theorem 5 yields the following Corollary 6.A compact scattered spaceXis not separable if and only ifC p(X)contains a [closed] copy of(c 0(Γ)) pfor an uncountable setΓ. Using results from [3, Example 2.16] and [5, Proposition 4.2] and Corollary 6 we have however that Example7.There exists a compact scattered non-separableXsuch thatC p(X) contains a closed copy of (c 0(ℵ1))pnot complemented in Cp(X) but (c 0(ℵ1))pcontains a copy of (c 0)pcomplemented inC p(X). Theorem 1(3) and Theorem 3 may suggest the following Problem 8.Describe suitable Tychonoff infinite spacesXand those lcsEsuch that every semi-embedding fromC p(X) intoEis embedding, i.e. an isomorphism onto the range. However, it seems to be unclear how to construct semi-embeddings ofC p(X) intoC p(Y) which are not embeddings. For specialXandY and injective mapsTwe have the following simple and easily seen Example9.IfXis an infinite Tychonoff space andYis its dense proper subspace, the restriction mapT:C p(X)→C p(Y) is injective but not semi-embedding. On the other hand, in [18] Leiderman, Levin and Pestov showed that in general, linear continuous surjections ofC p-spaces fail to be open. In fact they proved",
    "and easily seen Example9.IfXis an infinite Tychonoff space andYis its dense proper subspace, the restriction mapT:C p(X)→C p(Y) is injective but not semi-embedding. On the other hand, in [18] Leiderman, Levin and Pestov showed that in general, linear continuous surjections ofC p-spaces fail to be open. In fact they proved [18, Theorem 1.8] that there exists a linear continuous surjection ofC p[0,1] onto itself that is not open. Recall also that some 4 JERZY KA ¸ KOL, OND ˇREJ KURKA, AND WIES LAW ´SLIWA natural restrictions on spacesEin Problem 8 have been already noticed in [18] and [11]: (i) LetXbe a Tychonoff space andEbe an infinite-dimensional normed space. Then there exists no sequentially continuous linear surjection fromC p(X) ontoE w. (ii) IfEis an infinite-dimensional metrizable lcs andT:C p(X)→E wa sequentially continuous linear surjection, then the completion ofEis isomorphic toRN. HereE w meansEendowed with its weak topology. (iii) For casesE=C p(Y) we refer also [18]. A more specific version of Problem 8 might be also the following Problem 10.LetXbe an infinite compact space. Is it true that each semi-embeddingT:C p(X)→C p(Y) is an embedding for any compact spaceYif and only ifXis scattered. Note that ifT:C p(X)→C p(Y) is embedding with bothX,Y compact andYis scattered, thenXis scattered; this follows from [1, Theorem III.1.2]. Clearly, the converse implication fails in general. Having in mind Problem 10 we prove the following special case; this will follow from our Corollary 24. Proposition 11.LetXandYbe compact spaces andYbe scattered. (1)IfXis Eberlein compact, a semi-embeddingT:C p(X)→ Cp(Y)is embedding if and only ifXis scattered. (2)IfXis infinite and scattered, there exists a continuous linear injective surjectionT:C p(X)→C p(X)which is not open. In particular, if additionallyXis Eberlein compact,Tis not semi-embedding. For compact Eberlein scattered spaces{[1, α]} α<ω 1, we proved in [11, Theorem 3.2] that ifα≤β < ω 1andC p([1, α]) andC p([1, β]) are not isomorphic, thenC p([1, β]) is even not a continuous linear image of Cp([1, α]). There are however compact scattered spacesXwhich are not Eber- lein but for which Proposition 11 still holds. Corollary 12.IfXis the one-point compactification of the Isbell- Mr´ owka space andYis a compact scattered space, then a semi-embedding T:C p(X)→C p(Y)is embedding butXis not Eberlein compact. The above results may suggest the following natural question whether the space (c 0)pcontains a closed infinite-dimensional subspace which is not isomorphic to (c 0)p. This will follow from the next theorem. Theorem 13.LetE⊂c 0be a closed infinite-dimensional subspace of the Banach spacec 0. Letε >0. Then there exists an isomorphism T∈L(c 0)with∥T−I c0∥< εsuch thatT(E)is closed in the pointwise topology ofc 0. LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 5 Corollary 14.The space(c 0)pcontains a closed infinite-dimensional subspace which is not isomorphic to(c 0)p. 2.Preliminaries and definitions Recall the following two classes of metrizable dense subspaces ofRN: (c0)p={(x n)∈RN:xn→0},(ℓ ∞)p={(x n)∈RN: sup n|xn|<∞}. Let (c 00)p={(x n)∈RN:xn= 0 for sufficiently largen}. The space (c 0)pcontains a copy of (ℓ ∞)p. In fact, let (b n)∈c 0with bn̸= 0, n∈N. The map T: (ℓ ∞)p→(c 0)p,(an)→(a nbn) is an isomorphism onto its range, so (c 0)pcontains a copy of (ℓ ∞)p. The",

The map T: (ℓ ∞)p→(c 0)p,(an)→(a nbn) is an isomorphism onto its range, so (c 0)pcontains a copy of (ℓ ∞)p. The spaces (c 00)pand (ℓ q)pfor 0< q≤ ∞are properσ-compact dense subspaces ofRN. A significant role of the space (c 0)pis described by the following results from [10, Theorem 3.1] and [2, Theorem 1], respectively. Theorem 15(K¸ akol–Molto– ´Sliwa).For any infinite Tychonoff space Xthe spaceC p(X)contains a copy of(c 0)p. If TychonoffXcontains an infinite compact subset, thenC p(X)contains a closed copy of(c 0)p. Theorem 16(Banakh–K¸ akol– ´Sliwa).For any infinite Tychonoff space Xthe spaceC p(X)contains a complemented copy of(c 0)pif and only ifC p(X)admits a continuous linear surjection onto(c 0)pif and only if Cp(X)satisfies the Josefson-Nissenzweig property. Consequently, if a compact spaceXis scattered, thenC p(X) contains a complemented copy of (c 0)p. In [15] K¸ akol, Sobota and Zdomskyy showed that there exist compact non-scattered spacesXsuch thatC(X) contains a complemented copy of the Banach spacec 0butC p(X) does not contain any complemented copy of (c 0)p. In order to present Corollary 24 let us recall that a topological space Xis a ∆-spaceif for every decreasing sequence (D n)nof subsets ofX with empty intersection, there is a decreasing sequence (V n)nof open subsets ofX, with empty intersection, such thatD n⊂V nfor every n∈N, see [17], [13]. Knight [17] called ∆-setsall topological spacesXsatisfying the above definition. The original definition of a ∆-set of the real line is due to Reed and van Douwen, see [24]. Recall that a set of real numbersXis called aQ-set if each subset ofXis aG δset inX. Note that the existence of uncountableQ-sets is independent of ZFC. EveryQ-set is a ∆-set, but consistently the converse is not true, see [17]. K¸ akol and Leiderman [13] proved the following characterizations: 6 JERZY KA ¸ KOL, OND ˇREJ KURKA, AND WIES LAW ´SLIWA Fact17.For a Tychonoff spaceX, the strong dualC p(X)′ βofC p(X) carries the finest locally convex topology if and only ifXis a ∆-space, [13, Theorem 2.1]. Every compact ∆-space is scattered, [13, Theorem 3.4]. The compact scattered space [0, ω 1] is not a ∆-space, but an Eberlein compact spaceXis a ∆-space if and only ifXis scattered, see [13, Theorem 3.2] and [13, Theorem 3.7], respectively. 3.Proofs of Theorem 3 and Propositions 11, 18, 19 In order to prove Theorem 3 first we show the following crucial Proposition 18.LetKbe a scattered compact space andEbe a norm- closed infinite-dimensional subspace ofC(K). Then(E, τ p)contains an isomorphic copy of(c 0)pthat is complemented inC p(K). Proof.SinceKis scattered, we apply [14, Theorem 12 (5)] to show that there exists a sequenceu 1, u2, . . .of non-zero elements ofEsuch that for eachx∈K, only finitely manyn’s satisfyu n(x)̸= 0. Let us denote Fn= span{u i:i≥n}, n∈N. By [20, Theorem 11] of Lotz, Peck and Porta, F1contains a sequence h1, h2, . . .which is equivalent to the canonical basis ofc 0. We can find numbersε n>0 such",
    "non-zero elements ofEsuch that for eachx∈K, only finitely manyn’s satisfyu n(x)̸= 0. Let us denote Fn= span{u i:i≥n}, n∈N. By [20, Theorem 11] of Lotz, Peck and Porta, F1contains a sequence h1, h2, . . .which is equivalent to the canonical basis ofc 0. We can find numbersε n>0 such that any sequencef n∈C(K) satisfying ∥fn−h in∥< ε n for some subsequenceh inis also equivalent to the canonical basis ofc 0. Sinceh iconverges weakly to 0 and Fnhas finite codimension in F1, we have dist(h i, Fn)→0 asi→ ∞. We can choose a subsequenceh insuch that dist(h in, Fn)< ε n. For eachn, we pickf n∈F nsuch that ∥fn−h in∥< ε n. We have found a sequence (f n)ninEwhich is equivalent to the canonical basis ofc 0with the property that for eachx∈K, only finitely manyn’s satisfyf n(x)̸= 0 (since there isn 0such thatf(x) = 0 for eachf∈F n0). We claim that there is a subsequence of (f n)nthat generates a complemented copy of (c 0)pin the spaceC p(K). Leta >0 be such that∥f n∥ ≥afor everyn. For eachn∈N, we choosex n∈Ksuch that|f n(xn)| ≥a. Letn kbe indices such that xnkconverge to somey(see [20, Lemma 9] of Lotz, Peck and Porta), we can moreover ignore finitely many of these indices in order to have fnk(y) = 0 for eachk. We choose a further subsequence (f nkl) such that: LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 7 (i)f nkl(xnkj) = 0 forj < l, (ii)|f nkj(xnkl)|<2−(j+l)a/3 forj < l. Such a subsequence can be chosen recursively, since for eachj, only finitely manyk’s satisfyf nk(xnkj)̸= 0, and at the same time, fnkj(xnk)→f nkj(y) = 0 ask→ ∞. For simplicity of the notation, we denoteg j=f nkjand yj=x nkj, so |gj(yj)| ≥a, y j→y andg j(y) = 0 for eachj, and (i)g l(yj) = 0 forj < l, (ii)|g j(yl)|<2−(j+l)a/3 forj < l. We put g∗ 1=1 g1(y1)(δy1−δy) and recursively forl= 1,2, . . ., g∗ l+1=1 gl+1(yl+1)(δyl+1−δy)−lX i=1gi(yl+1) gl+1(yl+1)g∗ i. We want to show thatg j’s andg∗ j’s form a biorthogonal system. By induction onl, we check thatg∗ l(gj) equals 1 forj=land 0 for j̸=l. Note first that g∗ 1(g1) =1 g1(y1)(g1(y1)−g 1(y)) = 1 and, by (i), g∗ 1(gj) =1 g1(y1)(gj(y1)−g j(y)) = 0 forj≥2. Concerning the induction step, we can write g∗ l+1(gj) =1 gl+1(yl+1)(gj(yl+1)−g j(y))−lX i=1gi(yl+1) gl+1(yl+1)g∗ i(gj) =1 gl+1(yl+1)gj(yl+1)−lX i=1gi(yl+1) gl+1(yl+1)g∗ i(gj). The sum here equals to 0 ifj > land to gj(yl+1) gl+1(yl+1) 8 JERZY KA ¸ KOL, OND ˇREJ KURKA, AND WIES LAW ´SLIWA ifj≤l. Therefore, g∗ l+1(gl+1) =1 gl+1(yl+1)gl+1(yl+1)−0 = 1. Forj < l+ 1, we have g∗ l+1(gj) =1 gl+1(yl+1)gj(yl+1)−gj(yl+1) gl+1(yl+1)= 0. Forj > l+ 1, we have g∗ l+1(gj) =1 gl+1(yl+1)gj(yl+1)−0 = 0 by (i). Further, by induction onl, we show that∥g∗ l∥ ≤3/aand g∗ l+1−1 gl+1(yl+1)(δyl+1−δy) ≤2−l a. Clearly∥g∗ 1∥ ≤2/a≤3/a. Applying (ii), we compute g∗ l+1−1 gl+1(yl+1)(δyl+1−δy) = lX i=1gi(yl+1) gl+1(yl+1)g∗ i ≤1 a·3 alX i=1|gi(yl+1)| ≤1 a·3 alX i=12−(i+l)a 3≤2−l a. Hence we have ∥g∗ l+1∥ ≤2 a+2−l a≤3 a. It follows thatg∗ l(f)→0 for anyf∈C(K), because |g∗ l+1(f)| ≤2−l a∥f∥+ 1 gl+1(yl+1)\u0000 δyl+1(f)−δ y(f)\u0001 ≤2−l",
    "Clearly∥g∗ 1∥ ≤2/a≤3/a. Applying (ii), we compute g∗ l+1−1 gl+1(yl+1)(δyl+1−δy) = lX i=1gi(yl+1) gl+1(yl+1)g∗ i ≤1 a·3 alX i=1|gi(yl+1)| ≤1 a·3 alX i=12−(i+l)a 3≤2−l a. Hence we have ∥g∗ l+1∥ ≤2 a+2−l a≤3 a. It follows thatg∗ l(f)→0 for anyf∈C(K), because |g∗ l+1(f)| ≤2−l a∥f∥+ 1 gl+1(yl+1)\u0000 δyl+1(f)−δ y(f)\u0001 ≤2−l a∥f∥+1 a|f(y l+1)−f(y)|, which tends to 0. Finally, letSbe the operator defined in the following form f7→(g∗ l(f)) l. ThenSis a continuous linear mapping fromC p(K) to the space (c 0)p. This is because eachg∗ lis a linear combination of a finite number of Dirac measures. LetTbe the operator defined as follows (zi)i7→∞X i=1zigi. ThenTis a continuous linear mapping from (c 0)pto the spaceC p(K). Indeed, we know thatTis a norm-norm embedding ofc 0intoC(K), LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 9 the pointwise-pointwise continuity follows from the property that for eachx∈K, only finitely manyn’s satisfyf n(x)̸= 0. Next, we realize thatSTis the identity onc 0, since forn∈N, we have ST(e n) =S(g n) = (g∗ l(gn))l=en. It follows thatT(c 0) is a complemented copy of (c 0)pinC p(K), which is witnessed by the projectionP=TS. Indeed, P2=TSTS=TidS=TS=P, P(C(K)) =TS(C(K))⊂T(c 0) andP(T(z)) =TST(z) =T(z) for eachz∈c 0.□ Next we show Proposition 19 which will be used to prove Theorem 3. Recall first that a lcsEadmits a fundamental sequence of bounded sets ifEhas a sequence (S n)nof bounded sets such that every bounded set inEis contained in someS m. Proposition 19.LetEbe an infinite-dimensional separable reflex- ive Banach space. Then for every non-scattered compact spaceX, the spaceC p(X)contains a closed subspaceFisomorphic to the spaceE w endowed with the weak topology. Clearly,Fisσ-compact and has a fundamental sequence of bounded sets. Proof.The compact spaceXis non-scattered, so there exists a contin- uous surjectionϕ:X→[0,1].Clearly, the compact metrizable space Y= (B E∗, w∗) is locally connected in each point, so it is a Peano con- tinuum. Thus, by the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem [28, Theorem 2] there exists a continuous surjectionψ: [0,1]→Y.The continuous sur- jectionψ◦ϕ:X→Yis a quotient map, soC p(X) contains a closed copy ofC p(Y), see [1, Corollary 0.4.8]. It is easy check that the linear mapS:E w→C p(Y), x→f x,where fx:Y→R, g→g(x), is an isomorphism onto its range. We shall prove thatS(E w) is closed inC p(Y). Let (xα)⊂E, h∈C p(Y) and Sxα→αh inC p(Y). Theng(x α)→ αh(g) for everyg∈B E∗.It follows that the map ˆh:E∗→R, g→lim αg(xα) is well defined and linear; clearly, ˆh(g) =h(g) forg∈B E∗, so ˆh is continuous onY. Hence ˆhis continuous on (B E∗,∥ · ∥),so it is continuous on the set (E∗,∥ · ∥). Thus ˆh∈E∗∗. By reflexivity ofE, 10 JERZY KA ¸ KOL, OND ˇREJ KURKA, AND WIES LAW ´SLIWA there existsx 0∈Esuch thath(g) = ˆh(g) =g(x 0) for everyg∈B E∗. Thus h=f x0=S(x 0)∈S(E w). It follows thatS(E w) is closed inC p(Y). We have shown thatC p(X) contains a closed copy ofE w.□ Corollary 20.For every non-scattered compact spaceX, the space Cp(X)contains an infinite-dimensional closed subspaceFwithout any copy of(c 00)p. Proof.Note that the metrizable lcs (c 00)pcontains no fundamental se- quence of bounded sets, otherwise would be normed by the Kolmogoroff theorem, see [7,",
    "shown thatC p(X) contains a closed copy ofE w.□ Corollary 20.For every non-scattered compact spaceX, the space Cp(X)contains an infinite-dimensional closed subspaceFwithout any copy of(c 00)p. Proof.Note that the metrizable lcs (c 00)pcontains no fundamental se- quence of bounded sets, otherwise would be normed by the Kolmogoroff theorem, see [7, Proposition 6.9.4], which is impossible. A direct argu- ment: For every (α n)∈RNthe set{α nen:n∈N}is bounded inRN. For each sequence (V n) of bounded sets in (c 00)pthere exists (β n)∈RN such thatβ nen̸∈V nfor everyn∈N.Then{β nen:n∈N} ̸⊂V mfor anym∈N.Thus (c 00)pcontains no fundamental sequence of bounded sets. Using last Proposition 19 we complete the proof.□ Proof of Theorem 3.Using both Proposition 18 and Corollary 20 we complete the proof of Theorem 3.□ Using Theorem 2, Proposition 19 and Corollary 20 and their proofs we get the following Theorem 21.For a compact spaceXthe following are equivalent: (1)Xis scattered; (2)C p(X)contains no infinite-dimensional subspace with a funda- mental sequence of bounded sets; (3)C p(X)contains no copy ofE wfor any infinite-dimensional sep- arable Banach spaceE; (4) Every infinite-dimensional closed subspace ofC p(X)contains a copy of(c 0)p. We provide a short proof of the equivalence (1)⇔(3). IfXis scattered,C p(X) is Fr´ echet-Urysohn [1, Theorem III.1.2]. Recall a topological spaceWis Fr´ echet-Urysohn if for eachA⊂Wandx∈ W there exists a sequence inAconverging tox. AssumeEis an infinite- dimensional Banach space andE wis embedded intoC p(X). ThenE w is Fr´ echet-Urysohn, as well. Since Fr´ echet-Urysohn lcs are bornological [8, Lemma 14.4.3], the spaceE wis bornological (i.e. every absolutely convex and bornivorous subset ofE wis a neighbourhood of zero), what implies that the norm topology ofEand the weak topology ofE w coincide. HenceEis finite-dimensional, a contradiction. The converse (3)⇒(1) follows from Proposition 19. Corollary 22.If X is an infinite compact scattered space andC p(Y)is an infinite-dimensional closed subspace ofC p(X)for some Tychonoff LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 11 spaceY, thenYis compact and scattered andC p(Y)contains a copy of(c 0)pcomplemented inC p(X). Proof.The spaceYis compact by [12, Theorem 3.11], and thenYis scattered by [1, Theorem 3.1.2], and we apply Theorem 3.□ Recall that a lcsEisquasibarrelled, if every bornivorous absolutely convex closed set inEis a neighbourhood of zero. Recall also that a lcsEis calledstrongly distinguished[16] if the strong dualE′ βofE carries the finest locally convex topology. In order to prove Proposition 11 we need the following Proposition 23 which uses some ideas contained in [11, Theorem 1.2]. Proposition 23.Any polar linear mapTfrom a strongly distinguished lcsEonto a quasibarrelled lcsFis open. Proof.Let (U s)s∈Sbe a base of neighbourhoods of zero inEsuch that Vs=T(U s) is closed inFfor everys∈S.We shall prove that the set Vsis bornivorous inFfor everys∈S.Lets∈S. The adjoint mapT∗:F′ β→E′ βis injective and open onto its range T∗(F′ β), sinceE′ βcarries the finest locally convex topology and the finest locally topology is inherited by vector subspaces. LetAbe a bounded subset ofF. Then the polarA◦ofAis a neighbourhood of zero inF′ β, soT∗(A◦) is open inT∗(F′ β). Thus there exists an absolutely convex bounded subsetBofEsuch thatB◦∩T∗(F′ β)⊂T∗(A◦).Then we have [T(B)]◦⊂(T∗)−1(B◦) = (T∗)−1[B◦∩T∗(F′ β)]⊂A◦. By the bipolar theorem we get A⊂A◦◦⊂T(B)◦◦⊂T(B).

The setBis bounded inE, soB⊂tU sfor somet∈R. ThenT(B)⊂tT(U s) =tV s,soA⊂ T(B)⊂ tVs=tV s. It follows thatV sis bornivorous inFfor everys∈S.

Then Vr=T(U r)⊂T(W s)⊂T(W s)⊂T(U s) =Vs=V s, soT(W s) is a bornivorous absolutely convex closed set inF. Thus T(W s) is a neighbourhood of zero inF, soV sis a neighbourhood of zero inF. It follows that the mapTis open.□ For any ∆-spaceX, the spaceC p(X) is strongly distinguished (by [16, Theorem 6]) and quasibarrelled (by [7, Corollary 11.7.3]); any quo- tient of a quasibarrelled lcs is quasibarrelled, so we get the following. Corollary 24.LetXbe a∆-space. A polar mapTfromC p(X)onto an lcsFis open if and only ifFis quasibarrelled. 12 JERZY KA ¸ KOL, OND ˇREJ KURKA, AND WIES LAW ´SLIWA The unit segment [0,1], as well as [0, ω 1], are not ∆-spaces (see Fact 17), and a challenging problem of whether a non-open continuous linear polar surjectionT:C p[0,1]→C p[0,1] exists, remains unsolved, see [11] and [18]. Note (what will be used below) that ifEis a Fr´ echet-Urysohn lcs, every subspace ofEenjoys the same property, and every Fr´ echet- Urysohn lcs is bornological, hence quasibarrelled, see [8, Lemma 14.4.3]. Proof of Proposition 11.(1) IfYis a compact scattered space, then Cp(Y) is a Fr´ echet-Urysohn space, see [1, Theorem III. 1.2]. As the Fr´ echet-Urysohn property is inherited by subspaces, the imageT(C p(X)) is also Fr´ echet-Urysohn, so it must be quasibarrelled by [8, Lemma 14.4.3]. Assume thatTis an embedding. ThenC p(X) andT(C p(X)) are isomorphic. HenceC p(X) is also Fr´ echet-Urysohn. This implies thatXis scattered. For the converse, assume thatXis scattered. ThenXis a ∆-space, see Fact 17. AssumeTis semi-embedding. Fi- nally we apply Corollary 24 to get thatTis embedding. (2) SinceXis scattered,Xis zero-dimensional, and there exists in Xan infinite sequencex n→x. SetY={x n:n∈N} ∪ {x}. It is known that thenYis a retraction ofX, i.e. there exists a continuous mapr:X→Ysuch thatr(y) =yfor ally∈Y. Indeed, we embed Xinto some Cantor cubeDW. Hence we look atYas a subspace ofX, and the latter space is a subspace ofDW. By [6, Theorem 2] the spaceDWisAE(0)-space, so there exists a continuous retraction r:DW→Y. The restriction mapr|Xis a retraction fromXontoY. The functionq:Y→Xwithq(x) =xandq(x n) =x n+1for every n≥1 is continuous. The maph=q◦r:X→Xis continuous and {hk(x1) :k≥0}={x k:k≥1}, so the orbit ofhat some point is infinite. Letλ∈Rwith|λ|>1. By [18, Proposition 2.1], the mapT:C p(X)→C p(X), Tf=λf+f◦ his linear, continuous, non-open and surjective. Note that the mapTis injective. Indeed, letf∈C(X) withTf= 0. Thenf(h(z)) =−λf(z) for everyz∈X.Hence, by induction we get f(hk(z)) = (−λ)kf(z) for everyk≥0, z∈X.Thus supk≥0|λ|k|f(z)| ≤ ∥f∥ ∞<∞,sof(z) = 0 for everyz∈X.Hencef= 0, soTis injective. Now assume that Xis Eberlein compact. Then by part (1) we deduce thatTis not semi-embedding. The proof of part (2) is completed.□ Proof of",

Now assume that Xis Eberlein compact. Then by part (1) we deduce thatTis not semi-embedding. The proof of part (2) is completed.□ Proof of Corollary 12.By [13, Theorem 3.10, Example 3.17] the space Xis a ∆-space which is scattered separable, and Corollary 24 applies. Note thatXis not Eberlein [1, p.16], since separable Eberlein compact spaces are metrizable [1, Theorem III.3.6], but the Isbell-Mr´ owka space is not metrizable.□ LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 13 4.Proof of Theorem 5 and Corollary 6 Proof of Theorem 5.(2)⇒(1) LetTbe an isomorphism from (c 00(Γ)) p toC p(X). Letf γ=Te γforγ∈Γ.Then (f γ)⊂(C p(X)\\ {0}).For every (t γ)∈RΓwe havet γeγ→γ0 in (c 00(Γ)) pandt γfγ→γ0 in Cp(X). Thus for everyx∈Xand every (t γ)∈RΓwe deducet γfγ(x)→ γ0. It follows that (f γ(x))∈c 00(Γ) for everyx∈X. Thus the family {Uγ:γ∈Γ}:={f−1 γ(R\\ {0}) :γ∈Γ} of non-empty open subsets ofXis point-finite, so for everyW⊂X the set Γ W:={γ∈Γ :U γ=W}is finite. SinceS{ΓW:W⊂X}= Γ, the set W:={W⊂X: Γ W̸=∅} is uncountable and|W|=|Γ|. Clearly, Γ W∩Γ V=∅,ifW̸=V. Letγ(W)∈Γ WforW∈W. Then the family{U γ(W) :W∈W}is uncountable, so the point-finite familyU={U γ:γ∈Γ}is uncountable and|U|=|Γ|. By [25, Lemma 4.2], the spaceXdoes not satisfy the countable chain condition, so there exists an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint non-empty open subsets ofX. (1)⇒(3) Let{V γ:γ∈Γ}be a family of pairwise disjoint non- empty open subsets ofXand letx γ∈V γforγ∈Γ.For everyγ∈Γ there exists a continuous functionf γ:X→[0,1] such thatf γ(xγ) = 1 andf γ(x) = 0 for eachx∈(X\\V γ). Lett= (t γ)∈c 0(Γ). The functiong t:X→R, g t(x) =P γ∈Γtγfγ(x) is well defined. We shall prove thatg tcontinuous. Letε >0. The setM ε={γ∈Γ :|t γ| ≥ε}is finite and for x∈(X\\S γ∈ΓVγ) we haveg t(x) = 0.Thus we have {x∈X:|g t(x)| ≥ε}=[ γ∈Γ{x∈V γ:|gt(x)| ≥ε}= [ γ∈Γ{x∈V γ:|tγ|fγ(x)≥ε}=[ γ∈M ε{x∈X:f γ(x)≥ε/|t γ|}, so the set{x∈X:|g t(x)| ≥ε}is closed. Hence the setg−1 t((−ε, ε)) ={x∈X:|g t(x)|< ε}is open. Lets∈(R\\ {0}) andε∈(0,|s|).Then 0̸∈(s−ε, s+ε), so g−1 t((s−ε, s+ε)) =[ γ∈Γ{x∈V γ:gt(x)∈(s−ε, s+ε)}= [ γ∈Γ{x∈V γ:tγfγ(x)∈(s−ε, s+ε)}=[ γ∈Γ(tγfγ)−1((s−ε, s+ε)). Thus the setg−1 t((s−ε, s+ε)) is open. It follows that the functiong tis continuous. 14 JERZY KA ¸ KOL, OND ˇREJ KURKA, AND WIES LAW ´SLIWA Clearly,F:={g t:t∈c 0(Γ)}is a linear subspace ofC p(X). We shall prove thatFis isomorphic to (c 0(Γ)) p. The linear map T: (c 0(Γ)) p→F, t= (t γ)→g t=X γ∈Γtγfγ is continuous. Indeed, letk∈N, y 1, . . . , y k∈X, ε >0 and U={f∈F:|f(y i)|< εfor 1≤i≤k}.

LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 15 We prove that (β γ)∈c 0(Γ).Letε >0. Put Pε={γ∈Γ :|β γ| ≥ε}. The functionhis continuous, so the set Dε={x∈X:|h(x)| ≥ε} is closed, hence compact. We have Dε=[ γ∈Γ{x∈V γ:|h(x)| ≥ε}=[ γ∈Γ{x∈V γ:|βγ|fγ(x)≥ε}= [ γ∈PεVγ∩ {x∈X:|β γ|fγ(x)≥ε} ⊂[ γ∈PεVγ. Hence {Dε∩Vγ:γ∈P ε} is an open cover of the compact setD ε.The sets Dε∩Vγ, γ∈P ε are pairwise disjoint and non-empty, since xγ∈D ε∩Vγ, γ∈P ε. ThusP εis finite for everyε >0.It follows that (β γ)∈c 0(Γ),so h∈F. Thus the subspaceFis closed inC p(X). (3)⇒(2) is obvious. (1)⇔(4) follows from [25, Theorem 4.5]. (1)⇒(5): By [25, Theorem 4.5] the Banach spaceC(X) contains a non-separable compact setDin the spaceC(X) w. Since the pointwise topology ofC(X) is weaker than the weak topology ofC(X) and both topologies coincide onD, the implication follows. (5)⇒(1): Assume thatDis a compact and non-separable subset ofC p(X). LetBbe the closed unit ball inC(X) (which is closed in Cp(X)). Then there existsm∈Nsuch thatD m=D∩mBis still non- separable inC p(X). ClearlyD mis compact inC p(X) and bounded in C(X), so Grothendieck’s theorem [4, Theorem 4.2] applies to derive thatD mis weakly compact inC(X). Again [25, Theorem 4.5] applies to get the item (1).□ Proof of Corollary 6.IfXis non-separable, then the family{{x}: xis isolated point ofX}of pairwise disjoint open subsets ofXis un- countable.□ A slight modification of the proof of Theorem 5 and [25, Remark, p. 227] shows also the following Theorem 25.LetXbe a compact space. Then the spaceC p(X)con- tains a closed copy of(c 0(Γ)) pfor some setΓif and only if there is a family{V γ:γ∈Γ}of pairwise disjoint non-empty open subsets ofX. 16 JERZY KA ¸ KOL, OND ˇREJ KURKA, AND WIES LAW ´SLIWA 5.Proof of Theorem 13 and Corollary 14 Proof of Theorem 13.We can suppose thatε <1.

Let us choose numbersε n>0 such that ∞X n=1εn≤1 2εand∞Y n=1(1 +ε n)≤2.

Concerning the first stepn= 1, we just note that (i) holds sinceb 1=a 1. The other properties can be proved in the same way as in the induction stepn−1→n. Let us assume thatn∈Nand that the properties are shown for 1≤m≤n−1. We show that they hold also forn. (i) We use property (vi) forn−1 as follows. For 1≤m≤n−1, we compute v∗ m(bn) =v∗ m(Sn−1(an)) =u∗ m(an) = 0. Form≥n, we compute u∗ m(bn) =u∗ m(Sn−1(an)) =u∗ m(an), that is non-zero form=nand zero form≥n+ 1.

(vi) We use property (v) and the induction hypothesis as follows: We have v∗ n(Sn(x)) =v∗ n(Tn(Sn−1(x))) =u∗ n(Sn−1(x)) =u∗ n(x). For 1≤m≤n−1, we obtain v∗ m(Sn(x)) =v∗ m(Tn(Sn−1(x))) =v∗ m(Sn−1(x)) =u∗ m(x). Finally, form≥n+ 1, we compute u∗ m(Sn(x)) =u∗ m(Tn(Sn−1(x))) =u∗ m(Sn−1(x)) =u∗ m(x). Now, we see from (iv) that (S n)nis a Cauchy sequence inL(c 0), having a limitSwith ∥S−I c0∥=∥S−S 0∥ ≤∞X n=12εn≤ε. Since we assumed thatε <1, we obtain thatSis invertible. Also, v∗ m(S(x)) =u∗ m(x), m∈N, x∈c 0, as we havev∗ m(Sn(x)) =u∗ m(x) for eachn≥mdue to (vi). We finally deduce that S(E) =∞\\ n=1{x∈c 0:v∗ n(x) = 0}, which shows thatS(E) is closed in the pointwise topology. So, we proved our claim for the case thatEhas infinite codimension. In the opposite case, we can use the same method, with the difference that the sequenceA 0⊂A 1⊂A 2⊂. . .stops after finitely many steps, and the last isomorphismS nfrom our recursion works.□ Proof of Corollary 14.LetEbe a closed infinite-dimensional subspace of the Banach spacec 0which is not isomorphic toc 0, see [19, p. 73]. Let T(E) be the subspace ofc 0which is closed in the pointwise topology of c0as mentioned in Theorem 13. Denote byT(E) pthis space endowed with the pointwise topology. We show thatT(E) pis not isomorphic to (c 0)p. Assume (by contradiction) that there exists an isomorphism Q:T(E) p→(c 0)p. Then, applying the closed graph theorem between Banach spacesT(E) andc 0, we derive thatQ:T(E)→c 0is an isomorphism, which provides a contradiction.□ LOTZ-PECK-PORTA AND ROSENTHAL’S THEOREMS 19 References [1] A.
