    "PROOF OF A CONJECTURE OF GARVAN AND JENNINGS-SHAFFER ON THE NONNEGATIVITY OFM C1(m, n) ANDM C5(m, n) BING HE AND SHUMING LIU Abstract.In their 2016 paper on exotic Bailey–Slater SPT-functions, Garvan and Jennings-Shaffer introduced many new spt-crank-type functions and proposed a conjecture that the spt-crank-type functionsM C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n)are both nonnegative for allm∈Zandn∈N.Applying Wright’s circle method, Jang and Kim showed thatM C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n)are both positive for a fixed integer mand large enough integersn.Up to now, no complete proof of this conjecture has been given. In this paper, we provide a complete proof for this conjecture by using the theory of lattice points. Our proof is quite different from that of Jang and Kim. 1.Introduction A partition of a positive integernis a non-increasing sequence of positive integers whose sum isn.Letp(n)be the number of integer partitions of a positive integern and letp(0) := 1.Then the generating function forp(n)is X n≥0p(n)qn=1 (q;q) ∞, where(z;q) ∞is theq-shifted factorial given by [10] (z;q) ∞:=Y j≥0(1−zqj),|q|<1. The famous Ramanujan partition congruences state that p(5n+ 4)≡0(mod 5),(1.1) p(7n+ 5)≡0(mod 7),(1.2) p(11n+ 6)≡0(mod 11).(1.3) To explain Ramanujan’s partition congruences (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3), Dyson [7] in- troduced the rank of a partition as the largest part minus the number of parts. Furthermore, Dyson conjectured that the partitions of5n+ 4classified by their rank modulo 5 will produce five sets with equal cardinalityp(5n+ 4)/5.He also conjec- tured that the partitions of7n+ 5,classified by rank, will split into seven sets of 2000Mathematics Subject Classification.11P82; 11P21; 11P81.

Ifz= 1,then the above formula reduces to Euler’s celebrated generating function forp(n) : ∞X n=0p(n)qn=∞X n=0qn2 (q;q)2 n. LetN(r, m, n)denote the number of partitions ofnwhose rank is congruent tormodulom.Later, these conjectures were proved by A.O.L. Atkin and H.P.F. Swinnerton-Dyer [5] using the generating functions of the rank differenceN(s, l, ln+ d)−N(t, l, ln+d)withl= 5,7and0≤d, s, t < l.They proved that N(r,5,5n+ 4) =p(5n+ 4) 5,0≤r≤4, and N(r,7,7n+ 5) =p(7n+ 5) 7,0≤r≤6. However, the rank can not provide a purely combinatorial description of the Ra- manujan congruence (1.3). In his paper [7], Dyson also conjectured the existence of another partition statistics, the cranks of partitions, which gives a combinatorial interpretation of Ramanujan’s congruence for the partition function modulo 11. This partition statistics was later discovered by Andrews and Garvan in their paper [3].

LetM(m, L;n)be the number of partitions ofnwith crank congruent tommodulo L.In [3], Andrews and Garvan proved that M(m,11; 11n+ 6) =p(11n+ 6) 11,0≤m≤10.",

ON NONNEGATIVITY OFM C1(m, n)ANDM C5(m, n)3 A systematic account of ranks and cranks can be found in Chapters 2, 3, and 4 of Ramanujan’s Lost Notebook [2]. Letspt(n)denote the total number of appearances of the smallest part in each integer partition ofn.A generating function forspt(n)is as follows: S(q) :=∞X n=1spt(n)qn=∞X n=1qn (1−qn)2(qn+1;q)∞. In [1], Andrews introduced the spt functionspt(n)and proved three striking congru- ences: spt(5n+ 4)≡0(mod 5),(1.4) spt(7n+ 5)≡0(mod 7),(1.5) spt(13n+ 6)≡0(mod 13). These congruences are reminiscent of Ramanujan’s partition congruences (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3). In [4], Andrews, Garvan, and Liang introduced an spt-crankN S(m, t, n) and proved that NS(k,5,5n+ 4) =spt(5n+ 4) 5for0≤k≤4, and NS(k,7,7n+ 5) =spt(7n+ 5) 7for0≤k≤6, which provide new combinatorial interpretations of the congruences (1.4) and (1.5) of the spt function. They defined a two variable generalization of the spt function: S(z, q) :=∞X n=1∞X m=−∞NS(m, n)zmqn=∞X n=1qn(qn+1;q)∞ (zqn;q)∞(z−1qn;q)∞. It is obvious thatS(q) =S(1, q).Introducing an extra variable, they obtained a new statistic and refinement of the original counting function. In the same paper, by examiningS(ζ 5, q)andS(ζ 7, q)withζ 5= e2πi/5andζ 7= e2πi/7,Andrews, Garvan, and Liang reproved the congruences (1.4) and (1.5). Applying Bailey’s lemma to a Baileypair, theydeducedaninterestingformulabetweenR(z, q), C(z, q)andS(z, q) : (1.6)(1−z)\u0000 1−z−1\u0001 S(z, q) =R(z, q)−C(z, q). An overpartition is a partition in which the first occurrence of a part may be overlined. In 2014, Garvan and Jennings-Shaffer [9] applied Bailey’s Lemma to four different Bailey pairs to obtain several new spt-crank functions and proved many congruences on three spt functions for overpartitions and the spt function for partitionswithsmallestpartevenandwithoutrepeatedoddparts. Let spt(n)denote the total number of appearances of the smallest parts among the overpartitions of n whose smallest part is not overlined and letM2spt(n)denote the number of smallest ON NONNEGATIVITY OFM C1(m, n)ANDM C5(m, n)4 parts in the partitions ofnwithout repeated odd parts and smallest part even. The generating functions for spt(n)andM2spt(n)are as follows: ∞X n=1spt(n)qn=∞X n=1qn(−qn+1;q)∞ (1−qn)2(qn+1;q)∞, ∞X n=1M2spt(n)qn=∞X n=1q2n(−q2n+1;q2)∞ (1−q2n)2(q2n+2;q2)∞. In the same paper, they defined two variable generalizations for spt(n)andM2spt(n) by S(z, q) :=∞X n=1qn(−qn+1, qn+1;q)∞ (zqn;q)∞(z−1qn;q)∞, S2(z, q) :=∞X n=1q2n(−q2n+1, q2n+2;q2)∞ (zq2n;q2)∞(z−1q2n;q2)∞. LetR(z, q)denote the generating function for the Dyson rank1of an overpartition and letR2(z, q)denote theM 2-rank2of a partition without repeated odd parts. Applying Bailey’s lemma to two different Bailey pair, they [9] found two beautiful identities: (1−z)\u0000 1−z−1\u0001 S(z, q) = R(z, q)−(−q;q) ∞C(z, q), (1−z)\u0000 1−z−1\u0001 S2(z, q) =R2(z, q)−\u0000 −q;q2\u0001 ∞C\u0000 z, q2\u0001 . These two formulas are very similar to (1.6). Motivated by Andrews–Garvan–Liang [4] and Garvan–Jennings-Shaffer [9], Gar- van and Jennings-Shaffer [8] studied a family of spt-crank-type functions with the form: P(q) (z;q)∞(z−1;q)∞∞X n=1\u0000 z, z−1;q\u0001 nqnβn, whereP(q)is an infinite product andβ norginates from a Bailey pair relative to (1, q)and considered the Bailey pairs from group A in [16] as well",

They proved various congruences for these functions by using dissection formulas forS X(ζ, q)and found single series and product identities forS A5(z, q), S A7(z, q), SC5(z, q)andS E2(z, q)aswellasHecke-RogerstypedoublesumformulasforS A1(z, q), SA3(z, q), S C1(z, q)andS E4(z, q).At the end of their paper, they proposed the fol- lowing conjecture suggested by numerical calculations. Conjecture 1.1.Form∈Zandn∈N, M C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n)are both non- negative3. In [12], using Wright’s circle method [18], Jang and Kim4derived asymptotic formulas forM C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n)and showed thatM C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n) are both positive for a fixed integermand large enough integersn. As far as we are concerned, no complete proof of Conjecture 1.1 has been given so far. In this paper, we shall supply a complete proof of this conjecture by applying the theory of lattice points. Our method is quite different from that of Jang and Kim [12]. Let us now briefly outline the key steps to prove Conjecture 1.1. The nonnegativity ofM C1(m, n)is more complicated than that ofM C5(m, n).We first consider the nonnegativity ofM C1(m, n). In order to study the nonnegativity ofM C1(m, n),we need to consider the non- negativity ofX(m)(n),whereX(m)(n)is defined by (1.7)X n≥0X(m)(n)qn:=1 1−q2 ∞X n=1(−1)nqn(3n+1)+2mn 1−q2n−∞X n=1(−1)nqn(n+1) 2+mn 1−qn! . Whennis even, we can relate the coefficientX(m)(n)to the numbers of lattice points in some region ofR2.With the help of an important theorem [11, Theorem 9.2, p.123] due to the Czech mathematician M.V. Jarnik, we can get an estimate for the lower bound ofX(m)(n).This, together with other results, allows us to obtain the nonnegativity ofX(m)(n). The first result is as follows. 3In this paper, we letZandNdenote the set of integers and the set",

The first result is as follows. 3In this paper, we letZandNdenote the set of integers and the set of positive integers respectively. 4In [12], Jang and Kim writeM C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n)asN C1(m, n)andN C5(m, n) respectively.

Ifnis odd, thenX(m)(n)is nonnegative; ifnis even, thenX(m)(n)>0forn≥f(m). In addition to this result, we also consider the case0≤n≤20m. Theorem 1.2.Letmandnbe two non-negative integers such thatn≤20m.Then X(m)(n)is nonnegative. We next consider the nonnegativity ofM C5(m, n).In order to prove the nonneg- ativity ofM C5(m, n),we first study the nonnegativity ofY(m)(n),whereY(m)(n)is defined by (1.9)X n≥0Y(m)(n)qn:=∞X n=1(−1)nqn(n+1)+2mn 1−q2n−∞X n=1(−1)nqn(n+1) 2+mn 1−qn. We convert the nonnegativity ofY(m)(n)to the consideration of the numbers of four sets inN2.From this we can obtain the nonnegativity ofY(m)(n). Theorem 1.3.Letmbe a non-negative integer. ThenY(m)(n)is nonnegative for alln≥0. Combining Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, we can confirm Conjecture 1.15. Theorem 1.4.Conjecture 1.1 is true. In the next section, we provide some auxiliary results, which are crucial to the derivation of Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. Section 3 is devoted to our proofs of Theo- rems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. In Section 4, we show Theorem 1.4. 2.Auxiliary results We begin this section by recalling the following result of Jarnik concerning the problem of the number of lattice points inside a closed curve. Lemma 2.1.(Jarnik, see[11, Theorem 9.2, p.123]) Letl≥1be the length of a rectifiable simple closed curve and letAbe the area of the region bounded by the curve. IfNis the number of lattice points inside the curve, then |N−A|< l. The next result concerns the number of lattice points withy-coordinates being odd. 5In [6], Chan, Ho and Mao observed an interesting phenomenon that fewer terms in the denomi- nator of some theta series are needed and the corresponding theta series still possesses nonnegative coefficients. See also Zhou’s paper [20]. This observation can also apply to our proof of Conjecture 1.1. See the proof of Conjecture 1.1 in Section 4 for more details. ON NONNEGATIVITY OFM C1(m, n)ANDM C5(m, n)8 Lemma 2.2.LetNrepresent the number of lattice points in a bounded regionB,and letMdenote the number of lattice points within this region where they-coordinates are odd. Then N 2−M ≤sup P,Q∈B|x(P)−x(Q)|+ 1, wherex(T)denotes thex-coordinate ofT. Proof.Let m1:= min\b x|(x, y)∈B and(x, y)∈Z2 and m2:= max\b x|(x, y)∈B and(x, y)∈Z2 . For eachx 0∈[m 1, m2]andx 0∈Z,letN x0be the number of lattice points in B∩{(x 0, y)|y∈R}and letM x0be the number of lattice points inB∩{(x 0, y)|y∈R} with they-coordinates being odd. ThenN x0−M x0is the number of lattice points inB∩ {(x 0, y)|y∈R}with they-coordinates being even and so |(Nx0−M x0)−M x0| ≤1. It is easy to see thatN−Mis the number of lattice points in the regionBwith the y-coordinates being even. Thus, |(N−M)−M|= X x0∈[m 1,m2] x0∈Z((Nx0−M x0)−M x0) ≤X",

It is easy to see thatN−Mis the number of lattice points in the regionBwith the y-coordinates being even. Thus, |(N−M)−M|= X x0∈[m 1,m2] x0∈Z((Nx0−M x0)−M x0) ≤X x0∈[m 1,m2] x0∈Z|(Nx0−M x0)−M x0| ≤m 2+ 1−m 1 ≤sup P,Q∈B|x(P)−x(Q)|+ 1. This implies that N 2−M ≤sup P,Q∈B|x(P)−x(Q)|+ 1, which finishes the proof.□ From Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 we can derive the following results.

From the above generating functions we know thatM C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n)are both symmetric inm.Namely, MC1(−m, n) =M C1(m, n) and MC5(−m, n) =M C5(m, n). Thus, we only need to consider the nonnegativity ofM C1(m, n)andM C5(m, n)when m≥0, n≥0. We first considerM C5(m, n). Since ∞X n=1MC5(m, n)qn=1 (q2;q2)∞·X n≥0Y(m)(n)qn, we deduce from Theorem 1.3 thatM C5(m, n)is nonnegative form≥0, n≥0.

Note that f(m)>20m for0≤m≤120and f(m)<20m form≥121.In view of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, to study the nonnegativity ofX(m)(n), we only need to consider its nonnegativity for the case0≤m≤120andf(m)> n > 20m.With the help of the softwareMathematicawe can verify the finite cases that X(m)(n)≥0for0≤m≤120andf(m)> n >20m.This implies thatX(m)(n)≥0 for allm≥0, n≥0.Since ∞X n=1MC1(m, n)qn=Y j≥21 1−q2j·X n≥0X(m)(n)qn, we deduce from the nonnegativity ofX(m)(n)thatM C1(m, n)≥0for allm≥0, n≥ 0.This completes the proof of Theorem 1.4.□ Acknowledgement This work was partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11801451) and the Natural Science Foundation of Changsha (Grant No. kq2208251).
