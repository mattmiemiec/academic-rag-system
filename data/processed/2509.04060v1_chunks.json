    "JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 1 Physics-Informed Detection of Friction Anomalies in Satellite Reaction Wheels Alejandro Penacho Riveiros, Nicola Bastianello, Karl H. Jo hansson, and Matthieu Barreau Abstract —As the number of satellites in orbit has increased exponentially in recent years, ensuring their correct func tionality has started to require automated methods to decrease human workload. In this work, we present an algorithm that analyze s the on-board data related to friction from the Reaction Whee l Assemblies (RWA) of a satellite and determines their operat ing status, distinguishing between nominal status and several possible anomalies that require preventive measures to be taken. The algorithm ﬁrst uses a model based on hybrid systems theory to extract the information relevant to the problem. The extrac tion process combines techniques in changepoint detection, dyn amic programming, and maximum likelihood in a structured way. A classiﬁer then uses the extracted information to determine the status of the RWA. This last classiﬁer has been previously tr ained with a labelled dataset produced by a high-ﬁdelity simulato r, comprised for the most part of nominal data. The ﬁnal algorit hm combines model-based and data-based approaches to obtain satisfactory results with an accuracy around 95% .

I NTRODUCTION As satellites orbiting Earth have become more frequent during the last decades [1], the need to maintain their corre ct functioning has become a major concern of space agencies around the world. Being in space during their whole lifetime , satellite repairs are, in general, unfeasible, so failures usually lead to the termination of the mission. Even when a repair is possible, it tends to be very expensive, as was the case of the installation of a new camera for the Hubble telescope len s, which required an entire mission [2]. This makes the capabil ity of detecting impending failures a fundamental component of their monitoring. Among the components that can fail in a satellite, the Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWAs) are of particular interes t. RWAs are a fundamental component of the Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) of the satellite. Their purpose is to exert a torque on the body of the satellite to control its atti tude. Rather than using action-reaction principles as a Reaction Control System (RCS) does, an RWA uses angular momentum conservation to achieve greater accuracy with no propellan t A. Penacho Riveiros, N.

The operating principle of RWAs is fairly simple. Inside the assembly, a ﬂywheel is kept rotating permanently. When ther e is a need to rotate the satellite in one direction, the disc is accelerated in the opposite direction using an electric mot or. Due to the conservation of angular momentum in space, this produces the desired torque in the main body of the satellite [3]. To get complete control of the three axes of rotation of t he Fig. 1. Cross-section of a Reaction Wheel Assembly, adapted from [4]. satellite, at least 3 RWAs need to be mounted in a satellite. However, to achieve redundancy and some ﬂexibility in the speed of rotation of the discs, it is common to install 4 RWAs instead [5]. The RWA is, then, a mechanical component in almost permanent motion, making it more prone to failure than other ﬁxed satellite parts. Mechanical degradation, vibrations , and wear can occur in this element, compromising its integrity [6]. Particularly, the bearings, where contact between the rotating disc and the non-moving satellite body takes place , are home to several complex phenomena involving elasto- hydrodynamics (interaction between a moving ﬂuid, such as lubricant, and deformable solid material). These phenomen a cause sudden changes in friction at the bearings that make th e wheel modeling particularly challenging. A failure of a RWA might imply losing all device functionality and can serious ly compromise the mission’s success. Such has been the case in space missions Kepler [7], Dawn [8], and SDO [9], in which the capabilities of the satellites were compromised after R WA failures due to the loss of authority over the torque of the satellite [9], [10]. Although there have been attempts at explaining the causes of such failures [11], the complexity in the dynamics of the bearings makes it hard to determine the condition of the com- ponent, and the limited number of sensors in the RWA implies that a complete monitoring of the situation is impossible. E ven though the nature of these failures remains unknown, recent studies have shown that they are usually preceded by changesarXiv:2509.04060v1 [eess.SY] 4 Sep 2025 JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 2 in the behavior of the friction at the bearings, which can be observed using on-board sensors commonly installed in RWAs [12]. Such changes of behavior (that is, anomalies) are usua lly caused by changes in the properties of the RWA, such as alterations of the lubricant or an increase in the contact su rface in the bearings.

    "lly caused by changes in the properties of the RWA, such as alterations of the lubricant or an increase in the contact su rface in the bearings. It is then of interest to detect these changes in the behavior , as they can be used to anticipate possible future failures of the wheel and/or take mitigative measures to improve the health of the RWA [4]. However, not all changes imply a future failure, so it is also necessary to distinguish between different typ es of anomalous behavior to provide the appropriate warnings. Therefore, for this work, it is not enough to perform anomaly detection, but categorization should also be considered. In this paper, we develop a method that analyzes the on- board data collected from an RWA during a window of time of a few hours and determines whether an anomaly is present in the RWA and, if positive, which one among those known, with the entire process carried out in the satellite thanks t o its low computation cost. We propose the following contributio ns: •We derive a novel model for friction systems that incor- porates sudden variations of friction due to quick changes in the internal geometry of the system. The model can be implemented without knowledge of the actual causes of these phenomena, but rather just their statistical proper- ties, which can be obtained experimentally. •We provide an end-to-end algorithm that takes a window of a few hours of measurements by on-board sensors to determine whether the observed friction characteristics of the RWA belong to nominal or anomalous conditions. The method combines the use of the model together with data-driven approaches to provide an accurate diagnosis. •We include in the approach a modiﬁcation to the classi- ﬁcation of changepoints that accounts for the possibility of false negatives. This makes the algorithm robust to incorrectly detected changepoints, an unavoidable phe- nomenon due to the stochastic nature of the signal measured. •We thoroughly validate the complete algorithm and each of its components using high-ﬁdelity simulation data from Thales Alenia Space (TAS), with no knowledge of the model used to generate it. Literature review Anomaly and/or fault detection in satellites has received considerable interest in recent years, primarily due to the ir proliferation and the need for constant monitoring. Resear ch done in this direction has attempted to produce algorithms capable of analyzing all the information coming from the satellite to determine a wide variety of possibly faulty con - ditions. The high availability of data and the lack of models for the complete satellite has led to almost exclusively dat a- driven approaches, using tools such as Support Vector Ma- chines (SVM) [13], Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) [14], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [15], or LSTM networks [16]. These ideas have led to algorithms used in actual space missions, like Orca [17] in the International Space Station and the IMS tool [18] in the Space shuttle.Satellite-speciﬁc methods are very versatile as they can catch a wide range of possible malfunctions in the vehicle.

    "to algorithms used in actual space missions, like Orca [17] in the International Space Station and the IMS tool [18] in the Space shuttle.Satellite-speciﬁc methods are very versatile as they can catch a wide range of possible malfunctions in the vehicle. However, they consider the vehicle as a whole, ignoring the intricacies of each component. This makes them less sensiti ve to subtle changes in the behavior of any of these individual components. It is then reasonable to ﬁnd detection methods speciﬁc to the component of interest. Focusing on RWA, the simplicity and generally well-understood dynamics of these devices have allowed the development of more specialized technique s capable of leveraging expert knowledge. This has led to extremely detailed models to predict vibrations in the RWA [19], [20]. Although accurate, such models are unsuitable for anomaly detection during space missions, as they usuall y involve signals not available outside ground tests. The problem of fault and anomaly detection for RWAs has been analyzed mainly through machine learning [21], [22]. Although these methods have been effective in their purpose , they consider the behavior of the electric motor rather than focusing on the friction torque, so they are not so precise in determining abnormal behavior of the latter. This was done only recently using unsupervised machine learning [23 ], but considering only normal and abnormal behavior, that is, without isolation of the anomaly. Closely related to RWAs, rotary machinery analysis is a richer ﬁeld of literature. Although purely model-based ap- proaches have been proposed in the past [24], they are usuall y focused on alterations in the vibration patterns of the mach ine. Most of the research is based on data-driven techniques, capable of assessing a wider variety of faulty conditions usually related to problems in the bearings, as highlighted in the survey [25]. Most of the rotary machinery analysis techniques follow a common approach: ﬁrst, some signals are measured from the machine (usually displacement or acceleration), then feat ures are extracted (statistical ones like mean and variance, or frequency-related like Power Spectral Density), and ﬁnall y, some machine learning methods are used to determine the status of the machine from these features. Such methods include nearest neighbor [26], neural networks [27], SVM [28], linear regressions [29], or Broad Learning Systems (B LS) [30], among others. These methods have achieved important improvements in recent years by incorporating knowledge of a model of the machine, leading to the family of methods known as hybrid methods [31]. A popular technique is to fuse these two source s of knowledge through Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML), which has experienced a rapid development in the last years [32]. Although evident progress has been achieved as new fea- tures and classiﬁcation methods have been developed, their focus on the vibrational behavior of the machine makes them unsuitable for satellite applications, where this behavio r is not of much interest. Regarding friction-related research , most of the interest is on the low-speed behavior, where complex phenomena like the Stribeck curve or stick-slip occur [33]– [35].

In conclusion, there has not been any work in the study of friction systems (particularly RWAs) with random jumpin g friction behavior, which poses unique challenges for detec ting anomalies. This article aims to ﬁll the existing gap in the literature by providing a hybrid model-data-based anomaly detection and isolation algorithm. II. P ROBLEM FORMULATION We study the problem of determining if the friction torque of an RWA has an anomalous behavior based on a window of measurements taken by its sensor system at ﬁxed time intervals. Each measurement at time tk(wheret∈R, and k∈Nis the index of the measurement) consists of the spin rateωkof the RWA, the voltage Vk, and the current Ikin the motor that accelerates (or deccelerates) the RWA. Using conservation of angular momentum, energy equations at the motor and ﬁltering techniques, we can obtain an unbiased estimation of the friction torque fkat the bearings of the RWA using an estimator: J˙ω=Tmotor+f=KTI+f (1a) ˆfk=Jωk+1−ωk−1 tk+1−tk−1−KTIk (1b) whereTmotor is the torque produced by the motor, Jis the wheel inertia and KTis the torque constant of the motor. Additionally, the estimated ˆfkcan be ﬁltered to remove the effect of noise. In this paper, we do not consider the details of this estimation process, but rather assume that ˆfk=fk+ vk, wherevkis random noise with zero mean, assuming the estimation is unbiased. Since we are interested only in the friction characteristic s of the RWA, the input to our algorithm is a sequence of pairs of spin rate and estimated friction torque obtained in a window of time: X={(ωk,ˆfk)}N k=1. (2) Both the spin rate and the estimated friction torque are normalized using average values in historical data, so the variables take values of order 1. To ease the reading of the paper, a table with all the indices used in the paper is given i n Table I. Subscripts and superscripts that are part of the nam e of the variable are written upright (like Ncp) and those that are indices are written in italics (like ωk).

    "Several possible anomalies are considered, each due to different ph e- nomena occurring in the RWA. For a window of measurementsX, any anomaly can be active or inactive: the status of the RWA is deﬁned as a vector of boolean values specifying whether each anomaly is active or inactive: Θ ={0,1}Nanom, whereNcis the number of anomalies considered. Anomalies do not have an explicit mathematical description . Instead, our knowledge about them comes from a labeled datasetDwith windows of measurements annotated with the anomalies affecting the RWA that produced such measure- ments: D={(Xℓ,θℓ)}ND ℓ=1, (3) whereθℓ∈Θ. This dataset can be obtained from ground tests, in-orbit experience, or hight-ﬁdelity simulators, for exa mple. To illustrate the shape of the datapoints in such a dataset, and how they might differ depending on the anomaly, we show three examples taken from the TAS dataset in Figure 2. Some early observations indicate that, even in the nominal case, there are sudden variations of the friction independe nt of the spin rate (for example, the one close to measurement 4000 in the nominal case). Sudden changes in the bearings cause such variations due to, for example, oil accumulation s in small pockets. Although their presence does not necessar ily imply an anomaly in the RWA, they must be considered, since excessive friction changes due to these variations are usua lly concerning. A model that captures the behavior of an RWA must, therefore, model these sudden friction changes. Regarding anomalies, Anomaly 1 produces a constant in- crease of friction torque at all spin rates, while Anomaly 2 increases friction torque proportionally with the spin rat e. Additional anomalies relate to friction differences produ ced in the sudden events described in the previous paragraph. Based on these observations and the given dataset from TAS, we state the following problem. Problem Statement: Create a model that captures the behavior observed in the TAS dataset, and use it to produce an algorithm that can determine the anomaly affecting an RWA based on a window of spin rate and friction torque measurements. III. RWA M ODELING To solve the problem formulated in the previous section, we propose a hybrid approach to overcome the usual limitation o f purely data-based and model-based methods. In this section , we derive the model used for the model-based part, developed from a combination of dataset observation, knowledge of the RWA mechanism, and literature on the topic. A. Friction Model Since the data available for the detection of anomalies consists of spin rate and friction torque signals, we discar d the dynamical part shown in (1) and model the RWA as a friction system, that is, an algebraic relation between fri ction and spin rate: fk=fd ksign(ωk)+fvωk+vk (4a) fd k=f¯d+Ns/summationdisplay s=1fs k (4b) JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 4 Fig. 2.

F or each case, the anomalous run is shown in red while a nominal run is plotted in blue to help compare them. where (4a) corresponds to the classical dry and viscous fric tion with additive Gaussian noise v. The dry and viscous friction coefﬁcients fd kandfv, respectively, are at the basis of any friction model [37], but note here that the dry coefﬁcient is not constant and can change with time. Each component of (4a) models a different friction factor. Starting from the end, the Gaussian noise vhas three sources: randomness in the motion of the bearing and the contact inside it, sensor noise, and inaccuracies in the friction to rque estimation. Among all possible noise models available, the Gaussian one was chosen for its theoretical properties and i ts popularity in the literature [38]–[40]. The viscous friction, on the other hand, is produced by the lubricant inside the bearing [41]. This parameter is known to be affected by the temperature and the pressure of the lubricant, as well as its age [42]. However, these variation s take place in longer time intervals than we analyze; therefore, w e can assume this coefﬁcient to be constant during the periods of time analyzed with the algorithm. Note that, although constant, this coefﬁcient can still be affected by an anomal y that increases its value. Finally, the dry friction models the contact between solid surfaces. In the bearings of an RWA, this contact occurs between the the inner and outer races of the bearing and the balls, and between the balls themselves [20]. The contac t surface at every instant is not necessarily constant, which can lead to changes in the dry friction coefﬁcient. To represent these changes, we ﬁrst deﬁne in (4b) the dry friction coefﬁci ent as the sum of several terms, the ﬁrst of which is the constantbaseline dry friction f¯dthat remains constant at all times. The remaining components fs kare variable in time, and capture the effect of variations in the contact surface of th e bearings. The evolution in time of each of these components is described by what we refer to as a Friction Switching System (FSS). The motivation behind using several FSS in the model of a single RWA is to capture independent phenomena with different properties. Such phenomena can range from concentrations of pockets of oil (well reported in the liter ature [41] to displacements of the different components of the bearing (observed in the past but not well characterized so f ar [6]), which may have very different time scales. By modeling them with different FSS, we can also distinguish anomalies affecting one or another phenomenon, enhancing the accurac y of the categorization of anomalies. An example of using several FSS in a single RWA model is given in Example 1. B.

An FSS represents a particular phenomenon inside the bearing of the RWA, such as the distribution of lubricant, th e relative position of the inner and outer races, or any other aspect that may affect the dry friction. In these systems, th e variableqrepresents the current conﬁguration of the system, τis how long the system has been in that conﬁguration, andfis the friction generated by the system. Note that the conﬁguration only takes discrete values. These systems are indexed with the variable s, and the evolution of a system sis relatively simple. At every step, the system may jump to a contiguous conﬁguration qwith Pt s(q,τ)or stay the same. If it does not jump, the conﬁguration does not change, and τ, the number of steps since the last jump, increases by one. If it jumps, the conﬁguration qand the friction fproduced by the FSS change, and τgoes back to0. A visualization of a system FSS can be seen in Figure 3, and the dynamics are given formally by  qk+1 fk+1 τk+1 =  /bracketleftBig qkfkτk+1/bracketrightBig⊤ with prob. Pt s(qk,τk), /bracketleftBig q′f′0/bracketrightBig⊤ otherwise . (5) Two probability functions affect the behavior of the FSS. The ﬁrst is the transition probability Pt s(q,τ), which depends both on the current conﬁguration and on how long the system has spent in it. By including q, we can consider systems that spend different lengths of time in various conﬁgurations, a nd by including τ, we are not limited to exponential residence times, as it is common in stochastic Markov chains [43]. The second probability function is Pqf s(q′,f′), which de- termines the new conﬁguration and friction ( q′andf′in (5)) the system takes after it has transitioned. Since the fricti on depends only on the new conﬁguration, this can be written as (q′,f′)∼Pqf s(q′,f′|q) =Pf s(f′|q′)Pq s(q′|q). (6) JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 5 We set some assumptions on Pf s(f′|q′)andPq s(q′|q). For the latter, the FSS can only jump between contiguous states, that is,Pq s(q′|q) = 0 if|q′−q|>1. For the friction: the probability functions associated with different qcan not overlap, and the range of values of f′must increase with increasing q. Figure 3 shows an example of valid friction probabilities on the right side. To characterize a FSS, we need four elements: its num- ber of conﬁgurations qmax, its transition probability function Pq s(q′|q), its jumping probability function Pt s(q,τ)for every conﬁguration qand the friction probability function Pf s(f|q), also for every q.

Example 1 (Short term friction changes): We want to model sudden and short-lived increases of friction. This system h as two conﬁgurations: inactive ( q= 0, no friction increase) and active (q= 1, increased friction). The system stays inactive most of the time, getting activated only for a few steps befor e jumping back.

On the other hand, we do not know the friction probability function Pf s(f′|q′), which might be affected by an anomaly. C. Anomaly Modeling To conclude this section, we deﬁne how the possible anoma- lies in the RWA are represented in the proposed model. As mentioned in Section I, there are several possible anomalie s, and all of them affect the resulting friction experienced in the bearing of the RWA.

We consider each anomaly to relate to one and only one component of friction. For instance, the dry friction anoma ly θdaffects the base dry friction coefﬁcient, while the viscous friction anomaly θvaffects the viscous friction coefﬁcient. For the case of the switching systems, each FSS present in the RWA can be affected by one anomaly, represented by θs, wheresis the index of the affected FSS. In this model, we consider that the effect of the anomaly manifests itself onl y in the friction distribution function, that is, in the value s of the friction the system produces for every conﬁguration. Th is JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 6 relationship can be expressed mathematically as: f¯d=f¯d(θd), fv=fv(θv), (9a) Pf s(f∗|x∗) =Pf s(f∗|x∗;θs). (9b) Although the probability functions are unknown, they can be estimated using a dataset D, hence the need for a hybrid approach. IV. A LGORITHM DESCRIPTION The proposed anomaly detection algorithm uses the model developed in Section III to analyze the window of measure- ments under investigation and correctly diagnose the state of the RWA. As explained in Section III, the possible anomalies of the RWA affect the values of friction that each component (base dry, viscous and the FSSs) produces. The objective, th en, is to extract the relevant information from the data to do the classiﬁcation. The main challenge in the model presented in the previous section is the presence of several FSSs, each producing sudd en changes in friction at random moments. It is then fundamenta l to keep track of these changes to detect and categorize the different anomalies. For this purpose, the algorithm comprises four stages, each with a clear responsibility in the complete process. The ﬁrst stage, changepoint detection , determines the time- steps in which an abrupt friction change has occurred. The second stage is the friction estimation , which determines the dry and viscous friction coefﬁcients before and after every changepoint, that is, fd kandfvin (4a). The different friction coefﬁcients can then be used to calculate how much the friction changes at every changepoint. The third stage is th e maximum likelihood assignment , which determines which FSS has produced each changepoint by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data. With this information we can distingui sh the individual contributions f¯dandfs kin (4b). Finally, once the distribution of friction values of dry friction, viscou s friction, and every switching system is known, the anomaly classiﬁcation stage produces an estimated status ˆθusing an SVM trained on the dataset provided. A diagram illustrating the stages of the algorithm, along with the data ﬂow between them, is shown in Figure 5. A.

The process of obtaining the regions of change of friction in the signal is divided into two parts. First, we compute a metr ic that estimates the probability that the friction has change d for every step kin the data. Then, we ﬁnd local maxima of this metric that are above a certain threshold.

Starting with the metric, we use a normalized windowed Generalized Likelihood Ratio (wGLR) [44] with priors, de- ﬁned as: wGLR k= logP(X|jump atk) P(X|no jump at k), P(X|jump atk) = max fd1,fd2,fv/braceleftBig P(Xk−w:k|fd1,fv) ·P(Xk:k+w|fd2,fv)P(fv)/bracerightBig , P(X|no jump at k) = max fd,fvP(Xk−w:k+w|fd,fv)P(fv), (10) where logP(Xa:b|fd,fv) =b/summationdisplay k=aC/bracketleftbig fk−fd−fvωk/bracketrightbig2,(11a) logP(fv) =Wb/parenleftBig fv−˜fv/parenrightBig2 , (11b) withCbeing a constant that gets canceled in the computation of the GLR, and Wba parameter used to penalize large deviations of the viscous friction from the values that we expect to ﬁnd in the data. Remark 2: Like the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR), the metric computes the log-likelihood of two different hypotheses: a jump taking place at k, or no jump at all. One of the issues with the LLR is the need to consider the variables involved in both hypotheses, that is, the dry and viscous friction coefﬁcients. This problem can be addressed throug h marginalization, leading to the Marginalized Likelihood R atio or through maximization for the parameters, as we do in this problem, leading to the Generalized Likelihood Ratio [44]. The GLR was developed for cases where there is only one changepoint to detect, but there are several in our problem. Rather than computing the likelihood for the whole data, thi s issue is addressed by computing it in a window of wpoints around the hypothetical changepoints. The constant wis a hyperparameter of the algorithm selected from historical d ata, on the condition that this window size is smaller than the minimum distance between changepoints expected in the data . The last element in the metric is the use of a prior for the viscous friction P(fv). The purpose of this element is to avoid obtaining parameters in the optimization that ﬁt th e JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 7 data well but are not realistic.

    "is to avoid obtaining parameters in the optimization that ﬁt th e JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 7 data well but are not realistic. As we will see in Section V, a high penalization constant Wbcan improve the algorithm’s effectiveness when the window size wis small. The base viscous friction coefﬁcient ¯fvis obtained from historical data and, as it will be explained also in Section V, does not need to be very accurate to fulﬁll its objective. The purpose of this last term is to penalize parameters that deviate too much from the expected values. Its tuning is not trivial, so a parameteric study is conducted in the results section. The base viscous friction, ˜fv, is deﬁned using historical data, and should approximate the expected value of this parameter. Once the GLR has been computed, we must determine which points correspond to changepoints. The original GLR algorithm solves this problem by taking the point kat which the metric is maximized. In our case, however, we must take into account that there are several changepoints in the comp lete dataset. Therefore, we ﬁrst ﬁnd windows of contiguous mea- surements where the GLR is above a threshold GLR thrand, for each window, we designate the maximum among those points to be a changepoint kcp. The number of changepoints will equal the number of windows above the threshold found. The results obtained by this stage of the algorithm depend on how its main hyperparameter, the threshold, is set. Under the assumption that the dry friction coefﬁcient is constant and the viscous friction coefﬁcient is correctly estimated with ˜fv, Wilk’s theorem shows that GLR /σ2 v∼χ2, whereσ2 vis the variance of the noise in the signal [45]. This provides a good way to determine the threshold: if we want to have a false positive probability smaller than 10−9, we ﬁnd the value of the threshold such that P(χ2>GLR thr/σ2 v)<10−9. However, a high threshold will also reduce the probability o f detecting changepoints. An analysis of this trade-off is do ne in Section V. The output of the algorithm is the ﬁnal list/braceleftbig kcp i/bracerightbigNcp i=1of all changepoints detected in the window of measurements. B. Friction Estimation Once the changepoints have been obtained, we want to determine the dry friction coefﬁcient between changepoint s, plus the viscous friction in the data. Since the friction mod el we are using is linear both in the dry and the viscous friction parameters, we can use least-squares to estimate t hese parameters. This stage of the algorithm takes as input the original signalX={(ωk,fk)}N k=1, together with the location of the changepoints estimated in the previous step/braceleftbig kcp i/bracerightbigNcp i=1obtained in the changepoint detection. The algorithm’s output is a vector with the value of the dry friction coefﬁcient at each interval, and the viscous friction, which was assumed to rem ain constant along the whole trajectory being analyzed. First, we determine the regions in which the dry friction coefﬁcient stays constant: the intervals between changepo ints. Each interval iis deﬁned by the ﬁrst",
    "of the dry friction coefﬁcient at each interval, and the viscous friction, which was assumed to rem ain constant along the whole trajectory being analyzed. First, we determine the regions in which the dry friction coefﬁcient stays constant: the intervals between changepo ints. Each interval iis deﬁned by the ﬁrst ( ko i) and last ( kf i)measurement included in it. These measurement indexes are computed as: ko i=/braceleftBigg 0 ifi= 1, kcp i−1+∆kerror otherwise ,(12) kf i=/braceleftBigg N ifi=Ncp+1, kcp i−∆kerror otherwise .(13) Due to the randomness in the noise affecting the measured signals, a changepoint may be detected some steps before or after the actual change in the friction coefﬁcient. We ignor e the points near the changepoints to avoid the negative effec ts that these may have on estimating these coefﬁcients. We can take∆kerror=w/2for small window sizes, which has been observed to give good results. With this process we obtain a total ofNintintervals, where Nint=Ncp+1. The model in (4a) can then be written for all steps kin the following linear algebraic form: Y=H/bracketleftBigg F fv/bracketrightBigg +v (14) whereHandYare deﬁned in (15) as the concatenation of individual HiandYimatrices (given by (16)) for each interval, vis Gaussian noise with covariance σv, andFis a vector containing the dry friction coefﬁcients for each interval: H= H1 H2 ...

Since Equation (14) is linear in Fandfv, we can use a least-squares to obtain an unbiased estimation of Fandfv: /bracketleftBiggˆF ˆfv/bracketrightBigg =/parenleftbig HTH/parenrightbig−1HTY. Due to the random nature of the noise, there is an un- avoidable probability that the changepoint detector is tri ggered at false positives. To analyze the likelihood that a certain changepoint was incorrectly detected, we deﬁne the metric crjct i, corresponding to the increase in the squared error of the friction estimation if the changepoint iis rejected (that is, ignored), and intervals iandi+ 1 are assumed to have the same friction coefﬁcient. It is computed as: crjct i=(HTH)i:i(HTH)(i+1):(i+1) (HTH)i:i+(HTH)(i+1):(i+1)(ˆFi−ˆFi+1)2,(17) JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 8 and will be used in the next step to decide which changepoints to consider false positives. The output of this stage is then the estimated dry friction at each interval, the estimated viscous friction, and the reje ction cost of every changepoint: (ˆF,ˆfv,{crjct i}Ncp i=1). With the total dry and viscous friction torques at each interval obtained in this stage, the next stage will focus on determining the individual contribution of each FSS to the friction. C. Maximum Likelihood Assignment Once the total dry friction coefﬁcient ˆfd ihas been estimated for each interval, we are interested in decomposing this fri ction among the different FSSs, that is, to obtain the value of the various components of (4b) at every step,",
    "of each FSS to the friction. C. Maximum Likelihood Assignment Once the total dry friction coefﬁcient ˆfd ihas been estimated for each interval, we are interested in decomposing this fri ction among the different FSSs, that is, to obtain the value of the various components of (4b) at every step, rather than only th e sum of them. To achieve this, we use the knowledge of the transition probability of the subsystems deﬁned in (5) toge ther with the steps kcp iat which the friction changes took place to determine the most likely sequence of conﬁgurations that th e subsystems went through. Once this sequence has been estimated, we can determine the values of each subsystem’s friction coefﬁcients ˆfs kand the base dry friction ˆf¯d. Since the dry and viscous coefﬁcients are a function of the anomalies present in the RWA, as considered in Equation (9), we will use their values for the diagnosis. Formally, the algorithm takes the friction values, rejecti on costs, and location of the changepoints as input. It estimat es the base dry friction, and the friction values of each subsys tem at each conﬁguration (that is, all the elements in (4b)). 1) Maximum likelihood jumping: The ﬁrst step is to deter- mine which FSS has produced each one of the changepoints detected by the ﬁrst stage of the algorithm. The output, then , is a vectoru∈NNcpwhere each entry uiis the index of the FSS that has caused the changepoint i. The objective is to determine theusuch that the jumps have the highest likelihood, with the probabilities given by the functions Pt sandPq s. The log-likelihood of a speciﬁc sequence of jumps can be computed sequentially, which makes dynamic program- ming a natural choice to ﬁnd the vector uthat maximizes it. A multistage dynamic programming is deﬁned by four elements: a state set ( X), an input set (U), a transition function (h:X×U/mapsto→X ), and a cost function ( g:X×U/mapsto→ R) [46]. The objective is to solve the following optimization proble m: u∗=argmax uNc/summationdisplay i=1g(xi,ui) (18a) s.t.xi+1=hi(xi,ui) (18b) Extending the notation used in Section III-B, we deﬁne the state of the RWA at every interval iwith a tuple of two ele- ments: the conﬁguration qiof each subsystem and the number of stepsτisince each subsystem changed conﬁguration for the last time, both given as vectors with as many elements as subsystems present in the RWA, so xi= (qi,τi), with qi=/bracketleftBig q1 i···qNs i/bracketrightBigT andτi=/bracketleftBig τ1 i···τNs i/bracketrightBigT .With this notation, qs irepresents the conﬁguration of the FSS with index sat interval i. Every changepoint iis characterized by two variables: the number of steps since the previous changepoint ( ∆τi), and the sign of the change of friction ( ∆fi), which can be either −1for a decrease or1for an increase of the friction. At a changepoint, one of the subsystems changes its conﬁguration by ∆fiand its number of steps since the last changepoint is reset to 0. The other subsystems have unaffected conﬁgurations, but their τ increases by ∆τi. We choose which subsystem has jumped at each stage with the",
    "of the friction. At a changepoint, one of the subsystems changes its conﬁguration by ∆fiand its number of steps since the last changepoint is reset to 0. The other subsystems have unaffected conﬁgurations, but their τ increases by ∆τi. We choose which subsystem has jumped at each stage with the input ui. The set of possible inputs is U∈/llbracket1,Ns/rrbracket, and the transition function is, according to the description given before, hi(xi,ui) = (qi+∆fieui,(τi+∆τi)(1−eui)),(19) where 1is a vector with all entries equal to 1andeuis a vector with all entries 0except the u-th one, which takes a value of 1. A visualization of the possible transitions of a system is given in Figure 6. Regarding the transition costs of the problem, they are give n by the log-likelihood of the event: gi(xi,ui) =/summationdisplay s/negationslash=uilogP¬t s(qs,τs,τs+∆τ) +logP¬t ui(qui,τui,τui+∆τui−1) (20) +logPt ui(qui,τui+∆τ)+logPq ui(qui+∆fi|qui). In this computation, we deﬁne P¬t s(q,k1,k2)as the probability of the switching system snot transitioning away from its conﬁguration qbetween steps k1andk2. It can be calculated as P¬t s(q,k1,k2) =k2/summationdisplay k=k1log/bracketleftbig 1−Pt s(q,k)/bracketrightbig . (21) Recalling Remark 1, we know Pt s(q,τ)andPq s(q′|q), so we can compute all the log-likelihood scores, either as the dynamic programming problem is being solved, or in advance, and then use look-up tables during the execution of the algorithm. The objective, then, is to obtain a sequence of in puts umaximizes log-likelihood. This is a standard dynamic pro- gramming problem that can be solved with classical algorith ms [46]. Note that while the possible values of qare relatively limited, this is not the case for τ, and the number of possible states may increase exponentially with the number of stages . For the initial state x0of the dynamic programming prob- lem, we take an optimistic approach: for q0, we initialize the algorithm considering all possible values, and keep the one that provides the maximum ﬁnal score. Regarding τ0, we select the value that maximizes the score in (20). The solution u∗, obtained by solving (18), provides then the index of FSS that produced each sudden change of friction observed in the data. Additionally, we denote x∗the sequence of states obtained by applying this input. 2) Changepoint rejection: The algorithm presented is inher- ently fragile: if a changepoint is missed during the ﬁrst sta ge of the algorithm, or a false positive is obtained, the algori thm will fail to obtain the correct sequence of conﬁgurations of the JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 9 qi=/bracketleftBigg 0 1/bracketrightBigg τi=/bracketleftBigg 50 0/bracketrightBigg qi+1=/bracketleftBigg 1 1/bracketrightBigg ,τi+1=/bracketleftBigg 0 80/bracketrightBigg qi+1=/bracketleftBigg 0 2/bracketrightBigg ,τi+1=/bracketleftBigg 130 0/bracketrightBiggqi+1=/bracketleftBigg 0 1/bracketrightBigg ,τi+1=/bracketleftBigg 130 80/bracketrightBigg ui= 1 ui= 2ui= 0 Fig. 6.

Unfortunately, designing a changepoint detection al go- rithm that detects all actual changepoints with no possibil ity of false positives is impossible due to the randomness of the noise that affects the friction torque measurements. Since we want the algorithm to perform well even in the presence of false positives, we robustify it by including in the dynamic programming problem the option at every stage of ignoring the changepoint detected, rather than ﬁtting it in one of the FSS. This is done by including 0as an additional possible input, shown in Figure 6, with the following transi tion and cost functions: hi(xi,0) = (qi,τi+1∆τi). (22) The cost of this transition is given by the log-likelihood of none of the switching systems jumping during this stage, plu s the added cost of rejecting this changepoint. Formally, thi s is written as g(xi,0) =crjct i+/summationdisplay sP¬t(qs,τs,τs+∆τ). (23) Recalling (17), this additional cost is given by how much the squared error of the regression increases when the changepo int is removed and the same friction coefﬁcient is estimated bef ore and after it. Therefore, the algorithm is more likely to igno re changepoints when the intervals before and after them have similar friction coefﬁcients. 3) Friction Values: Once the dynamic programming algo- rithm is ﬁnished, we get a vector ucontaining the index of the FSS that changed conﬁguration at each changepoint and an array qwith the conﬁguration of every FSS after every changepoint. The next objective is to estimate the base dry frictionˆf¯dand, for each FSS, the sequence of conﬁgurations and friction values it goes through. We denote them as Qs andFsrespectively, both deﬁned as lists of values in the programming sense, where sdenotes the index of the FSS. At every interval, the total dry friction torque must be the base dry friction plus the contribution of each FSS as given by (4b). This problem is solved in Algorithm 1. We start by assuming that, before the ﬁrst changepoints, the friction produced b y each FSS is equal to 0. Then, we compute the following friction values from the differences obtained at each chang e- point. Finally, since the minimum value produced by an FSSis assumed to be 0, we adjust the coefﬁcients to get the ﬁnal values.

    "friction ( ˆf¯d, the estimated viscous friction coefﬁcient ( ˆfv), and the sequence of states ( Qs) and friction values (Fs) each FSS goes through: (ˆf¯d,ˆfv,{Qs,Fs}Ns s=1). D. Anomaly Classiﬁcation The ﬁnal stage is the anomaly classiﬁcation, in which the friction coefﬁcients obtained in the last step are used t o determine the anomaly status of each component affecting th e friction torque in the RWA. This step, then, takes the assigned friction coefﬁcients ˆf¯d, ˆfvand{(Qs,Fs)}for each FSS s, and produces a diagnosis for the dry friction ˆθd, a diagnosis for the viscous friction ˆθvand one diagnosis for each switching system ˆθs. These diagnoses are independent from each other: ˆθddepends only onˆf¯d,ˆθvonˆfv, and the diagnosis of each subsystem is done with the friction values associated to it. We can then treat e ach of these classiﬁcation problems as independent. As mentioned in Section III, we have knowledge of which part of the friction model is affected by each anomaly; however, we do not know how it is affected. To address this shortcoming, we use the labeled dataset D, where we have a collection of datapoints with the anomalies associated wi th them. For each datapoint in the dataset, we run the ﬁrst three steps of the algorithm to obtain a processed dataset Dp=/braceleftBig/parenleftBig ˆf¯d,ˆfv,{(Qs,Fs)}Ns s=1/parenrightBig/bracerightBigND i=1. (24) This dataset we can be split into 2+Nsdifferent datasets, one for each anomaly: D¯d=/braceleftBig/parenleftBig ˆf¯d,θd/parenrightBig/bracerightBig , Dv=/braceleftBig/parenleftBig ˆfv,θv/parenrightBig/bracerightBig , (25a) Ds=/braceleftBig/parenleftBig {(Qs,Fs)}Ns s=1,θs/parenrightBig/bracerightBig ∀s∈[1,Ns]. (25b) JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 10 In our problem, the status of each anomaly is given by a simple binary label: active or inactive. In our pursue of a simple and effective tool for the classiﬁcation, we choose t o use Support Vector Machines (SVM) [47]. By deﬁning one SVM per anomaly, we can train them on the corresponding independent dataset. An SVM is a classiﬁcation method that takes as input a vectorz∈Rnand produces an output y∈{−1,1}according to the following equation: ˆθ(h) =sign/parenleftbig wTz+b/parenrightbig . (26) The classiﬁer is parametrized by the weights wand the bias b. Although not as versatile as state-of-the-art neural netwo rks, SVMs have two important advantages due to their reduced number of parameters: they are less prone to overﬁtting, and doing inference is computationally less expensive. Althou gh we use SVMs to classify all anomalies, the implementations vary depending on whether we are determining a dry friction anomaly, a viscous friction anomaly, or an anomaly related t o an FSS. 1) Dry and viscous friction anomalies: The ﬁrst two anomalies involve an increased value in the base dry and viscous friction coefﬁcients, respectively. The classiﬁc ation, therefore, consists in analyzing a single value in each case , eitherz=ˆf¯dorz=ˆfv. This is accomplished by deﬁning an SVM that takes values inR1as inputs, making the classiﬁcation a simple threshold learned from the dataset. 2) Subsystem anomalies: Classifying anomalies for switch- ing systems is more challenging, since we do not have a single value to classify with, but a sequence of them in the form of Fs. As mentioned in Subsection III-C,",
    "inR1as inputs, making the classiﬁcation a simple threshold learned from the dataset. 2) Subsystem anomalies: Classifying anomalies for switch- ing systems is more challenging, since we do not have a single value to classify with, but a sequence of them in the form of Fs. As mentioned in Subsection III-C, an anomaly impacts the probability distribution of the friction produced by th e FSS, so constructing a histogram from the friction values an d feeding it to an SVM that does the classiﬁcation is a reasonab le approach. The normalized histogram vector of the FSS with index s is deﬁned as z∈Rnbins, obtained from a sequence of friction valuesfkas ∀j∈{1,...,n bins}, zj=1 |Fs|/summationdisplay f∈Fs1f∈[rj,rj+1],(27a) rj=rmin+j nbins(rmax−rmin).(27b) Two hyperparameters must be deﬁned, the number of bins (nbins) and the limit values ( rminandrmax). The latter can be determined from the historical data, by annotating the minimum and maximum values of friction observed. The number of bins to select is a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. A small number of bins may make distinguishing an anomaly impossible, while a large number will lead to a large histogram vector, which may complicate training and lead to overﬁtting. For our task, we select a value of 20bins, and later analyze the effect of this hyperparameter on the accuracy of the algorithm in Section V-D2. The last decision to take is which values of friction to include in the histogram. From the previous section, we reca ll that we obtain, for each subsystem, a collection of frictionvalues paired with their corresponding conﬁgurations. Bas ed on our knowledge of the anomaly, we can decide to include all friction values produced by the FSS in the histogram, or only those related to speciﬁc conﬁgurations (for example, o nly friction values obtained with q= 1). The output of this ﬁnal stage is a tuple with the status of each possible anomaly, (ˆθd,ˆθv,{ˆθs}Ns s=1). V. R ESULTS We now proceed to analyze the model and the algorithm developed in the paper. As mentioned in Section I, this work aims to create an anomaly detection algorithm for the TAS use case. There are three objectives pursued in this section. The ﬁrst is to show the adequacy of the model proposed in Section III to the dataset provided by TAS, so we can conﬁrm that it captures the behavior observed in the dataset with accuracy. The second objective is to analyze the algorithm’s effectivene ss in detecting anomalies for the TAS use case. Finally, we want to study the effect of some hyperparameters of the algorithm whose tuning is not straightforward. The algorithm’s structure, composed of four sequential stages, is beneﬁcial for analysis, as each part of the algori thm can be analyzed independently to ensure it works as expected . This way, our analysis is not limited to the ﬁnal accuracy obtained by the last stage. Unfortunately, while we have a ground truth in the classiﬁcation because the dataset is labeled, we do not have such a reference for the output of the different stages of the algorithm. Therefore, we will us",
    "our analysis is not limited to the ﬁnal accuracy obtained by the last stage. Unfortunately, while we have a ground truth in the classiﬁcation because the dataset is labeled, we do not have such a reference for the output of the different stages of the algorithm. Therefore, we will us e various methods to assess other aspects of the work. Rather than organizing this section by objectives, we or- ganize it by stages of the algorithm. We start by analyzing the changepoint detection stage using synthetic data. For the friction estimation and changepoint assignment, we use the TAS dataset to analyze some performance metrics so, even without a ground truth to compare to, we can study the behavior of these stages. Finally, we will use the labels provided in the TAS dataset to assess the accuracy of the complete algorithm at determining the anomaly present in th e RWA. Additionally, we investigate the computational cost o f the whole process to establish its suitability for running i n a low-power device located in the satellite. A. Changepoint detection We analyze the ﬁrst part of the algorithm, which takes a time-series{(ωk,fk)}Nm k=1and determines the position of the multiple abrupt changes of friction. In the analysis of a changepoint detection algorithm, there are two main metrics of performance: the Missed Detection Rate (MDR), deﬁned as the probability of not detecting a changepoint, and the Average Run Length (ARL), deﬁned as the average number of points the algorithm goes through before detecting a false changepoint in the data [44]. Since it is always possible to improve one at the expense of the other (by decreasing or increasing the threshold GLR thr), the challenge lies in achieving a high ARL with a low MDL. JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 11 To assess the performance of the changepoint detection, it is important to remember how the subsequent stages of the algorithm process changepoints. As mentioned in Sec- tion IV-C2, an undetected changepoint can invalidate the algorithm’s output while a false positive can be rejected du ring the assignment stage. This implies that while high ARL is beneﬁcial, as it will lead to fewer false positives, a low MDR is fundamental for the algorithm’s success. For our analysis, we will ﬁx the MDR to 0.1%and deter- mine the threshold value at which such sensitivity is achiev ed using the χ2distribution. Then, we obtain the average run length with this threshold, which we call the ARL0.1%. A satisfactory value of ARL depends on the tolerance of the algorithm to false positives, and the number of points we process in a single window of measurements. In the TAS case, we analyze windows of around 80000 measurements, so an ARL of around 106is a good target if we do not want to get more than 1false changepoint per window. Since the TAS dataset has no annotated changepoint locations, these resu lts are obtained using our own simulations, in which we can place changepoints in a controlled way. 1) Bias selection: First, we analyze the",
    "good target if we do not want to get more than 1false changepoint per window. Since the TAS dataset has no annotated changepoint locations, these resu lts are obtained using our own simulations, in which we can place changepoints in a controlled way. 1) Bias selection: First, we analyze the effect of bias on the algorithm’s performance. Recalling Subsection IV-A, Wb is a tunable parameter, representing the weight of the prior on the viscous friction coefﬁcient in (10). Since there is no clear way of choosing this value to obtain better results, we run a parametric study to observe how it affects the ARL0.1% for different window sizes, assuming that the changes of dry friction we are trying to detect have a magnitude of 3times the noise standard deviation. The results are shown in Figure 7, left plot. A higher window size wleads to better algorithm results, as the effect of the noise is reduced when we use more points the w-GLR. However, increasing wis not always feasible, because it is limited by the minimum distance we expect to see between changepoints. We can observe how the Wbimproves the algorithm’s performance for different window sizes. As an example, using a window size of 20, we can improve the ARL0.01%from104to1010by increasing Wbfrom10−8to 10−4. The bias term is, then, a good way of improving the performance of the changepoint detection when the window size is constrained, and it seems from this ﬁrst analysis tha t Wbshould be set to be arbitrarily large. However, in the previous plot, we assumed that our esti- mated friction ˜fvis equal to the actual viscous friction fv. Unfortunately, this may not be the case, since the latter is n ot known in advance. Considering the effect of the bias ˜fv−fv is more complex: when the error is not zero, the w-GLR no longer follows a χ2distribution. We can, however, estimate the effect of this error to be in the order of Wb(˜fv−fv)2. As the original distribution of the w-GLR is of order unit, we should ensure that Wb(˜fv−fv)2≪1so the error does not have a noticeable effect. Using Wb= 10−4, this implies that we need|˜fv−fv|≪102, an easily achievable condition given that the viscous friction coefﬁcient is of order 1. This gives a simple rule for tuning Wb: if the window size is large enough (more than 50 points), it can be set to 0. If not, a high value can be set to improve the results, but keeping in mind that if the prior of the viscous friction is no treliable, the performance may degrade and produce too many false positives. 2) Changepoint properties: We now analyze the effect of the window size wand the size of the changepoints ∆fcp on the ARL0.1%, while keeping Wb= 10−4. The results are shown in Figure 7, right plot. We can see that better results are achieved with either high window sizes or changepoint strengths. This shows a basic limitation of the algorithm: i f we want to detect small friction changes, we need to use large window sizes. However, this might not",

This shows a basic limitation of the algorithm: i f we want to detect small friction changes, we need to use large window sizes. However, this might not be possible if the changepoints that we want to detect may be too close together, in which case we may need to increase the value of Wb. Fig. 7. Left: value of ARL0.1%for different window sizes wand biasWb, assuming changes in friction of ∆fcp= 3σv. Right: effect of window size and friction change on ARL0.1%, withWb= 10−4. As a last note, the average run lengths obtained in these analyses assume that the data contains no abnormalities, th at is, the friction is just a combination of dry and viscous friction and Gaussian noise as given by (4a). Real data may contain imperfections that trigger additional, unavoidab le false changepoints. Therefore, a high ARL is necessary for reduci ng the number of false changepoints, but it does not guarantee i t. B. Friction Estimation We now analyze the output of the second step of the algorithm: the friction estimation. This algorithm step is of no signiﬁcant interest since the Least-Squares algorithm has well-known properties, and th e only parameter to adjust is ∆k, which does not have a large impact on the output. We can, on the other hand, analyze how well the friction coefﬁcients ˆfd iandˆfvobtained in this stage approximate the friction ˆfkin the data. A small error is an indicator of a good ﬁt of the model to the data (at least when it comes to (4a), since we are not considering the different FSM yet) and a correct estimation of the changepoint locations. This is because, if changes in th e friction were not detected, the algorithm would try to ﬁt the same coefﬁcient to intervals of measurements with differen t dry friction coefﬁcients, which would produce a high error. We use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a metric of ﬁt, which measures the error between the friction values i n the data and those estimated using the intervals and the line ar JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 12 regression run in stages I and II of the algorithm.

(28) Additionally, we compute for each time-series in the TAS dataset a “naive” RMSE, obtained by ignoring changepoints and assuming the dry friction coefﬁcient to be constant alon g the whole time-series. The histograms of both metrics are shown in Figure 8, together with a 2D histogram that relates both RMSEs. To take into account the effect of the noise on the error, we estimate its standard deviation using a short wind ow of data and subtract it from the RMSE, resulting in what we call the excess RMSE.

    "into account the effect of the noise on the error, we estimate its standard deviation using a short wind ow of data and subtract it from the RMSE, resulting in what we call the excess RMSE. Fig. 8. Excess RMSE in the datapoints of the TAS dataset. The t op histogram is obtained by computing a single dry and viscous friction co efﬁcient for the complete time-series, the right one by obtaining severa l dry friction coefﬁcients from steps 1 and 2 of the algorithm. The mean valu es of the histograms are 0.13and0.0025 , respectively. While the excess RMSE obtained under the assumption of constant fdhas an average value of 0.13, it goes down to 0.0024 when considering a variable dry friction coefﬁcient. This considerable decrease reveals the importance of con- sidering the jumps of the dry friction coefﬁcient. The 2D histograms, on the other hand, show a lack of correlation between both errors. This suggests that no other signiﬁcant phenomena were present in the data that were not accounted for, as it would have produced a similar increase in RMSE with single and variable dry friction coefﬁcients. Although the RMSE obtained after accounting for change- points is small enough, considering that the minimum fricti on observed in the data is around 1.0, it is higher than what we would expect if the noise were the only source of error. If such were the case, we would expect a mean excess RMSE of0with a very small variance. To investigate further, we collect the absolute error obtai ned for every measurement in the TAS dataset and generate a survival function, shown in Figure 9. Assuming that Gaus- sian noise is the only source of error, we can compute the theoretical survival function using the χ2distribution and compare it to the experimental one. Differences between the two distributions give information about errors due to inco rrect estimations of the friction coefﬁcients. We observe a very close match between both functions until an error of approximately 0.08. As the value of theFig. 9. Survival function of the absolute error of the fricti on estimation for all measurements of all datapoints in the dataset, together with the theoretical distribution if random noise was the only cause of error. experimental survival function is approximately 10−3, we can see that out of every 1000 points,999 have an error that falls in the expected distribution, suggesting a good ﬁt of t he data. However, we observe many points with a higher error than expected, explaining the high mean RMSE observed in Figure 8. The fact that the fraction of points with high error is so small suggests irregularities in the data and occasion al estimation errors, rather than some fundamental issue in th e model or the algorithm. As in the previous subsection, there is a word of caution. Although a low RMSE is a good indicator of the correct ﬁt of the coefﬁcients, it is not a ﬂawless metric. An algorithm that detects more changepoints than necessary will produce a reduced RMSE. Although the previous subsection showed",
    "As in the previous subsection, there is a word of caution. Although a low RMSE is a good indicator of the correct ﬁt of the coefﬁcients, it is not a ﬂawless metric. An algorithm that detects more changepoints than necessary will produce a reduced RMSE. Although the previous subsection showed that the false positive detection was not a cause of concern, the following subsection will explore the issue of false positi ves in more detail. C. Assignment We analyze the assignment stage of the algorithm, tasked with determining which changepoints are caused by which FSS by running a dynamic programming algorithm to max- imize the likelihood of the assignment. As with the case of the changepoints, we do not have a ground truth of what the correct assignment of changepoints is. Instead, we will foc us on two elements of the algorithm: the number of changepoints rejected, and the number of iterations required before an assignment is obtained. Table II shows the number of changepoints rejected as a histogram taken over all the datapoints in the TAS dataset. A n unusually low number of rejections can be observed: 62% of the datapoints are processed with no changepoints being re- jected, while 96% of the runs require three or fewer rejectio ns. This shows that, while rejection is a needed component of the algorithm, it does not seem to be abused, considering that th e average number of changepoints per run is around 26 (with a standard deviation of 10).

JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 13 We are also interested in the computational cost of the algorithm, since it is well known that dynamic programming does not scale well with the number of states [46]. So, it is essential to remember this when analyzing the algorithm. To do this, we focus on the number of iterations the algorithm takes to reach an optimal assignment, as it is proportional t o the time it takes the algorithm to ﬁnish. In Figure 10, we show a scatter plot of runs from the TAS dataset by the number of changepoints they had, and the number of iterations it takes to compute their assignment. Additionally, we distinguish th ree groups according to the number of rejected changepoints: green for no rejections (accounting for 62% of the points), blue for 1 to 3 rejections ( 34% of the points), and red for more than three rejections ( 4%of the points). Fig. 10. Relation between the number of iterations run by the assignment algorithm before obtaining the maximum likelihood assignm ent, and the number of changepoints to assign.

    "likelihood assignm ent, and the number of changepoints to assign. The mean of 116.6iterations was obtained across all datapoints in the TAS dataset. For the case of no rejections, we observe the number of iterations to scale roughly linearly with the number of chan ge- points. However, some outliers can be observed (likely comi ng from time-series in which several assignment hypotheses we re kept until the end). However, this linear scaling is not as straightforward when the number of rejected changepoints increases. In this situation, the relation between the numb er of changepoints and the number of iterations becomes less predictable: at best, it stays linear, while at worst, it get s exponential. This randomness is suspected to be due to where the rejected changepoint is located. A false changepoint ma y be easy to detect, or require ruling out many alternative hypotheses, notably increasing the number of iterations. This points out the main limitation of rejection of change- points, as it makes the assignment problem much more expen- sive. We should, therefore, be careful with the Average Run Length set for the changepoint detection, and not expect the assignment to take care of all false positives. As a ﬁnal note, we must remember that, on average, the number of iterations is relatively small, around 115 iterat ions. This is because, although this number can reach high values when the number of changepoints and/or rejections is high, both numbers are relatively small for most runs. D. Classiﬁcation We present the paper’s main results now, namely, the algorithm’s accuracy in determining the anomaly affecting the RWA given a time series of measurements of spin rateand friction torque captured by the onboard sensors. Since the TAS dataset had a ground truth of the anomaly affecting the simulated RWAs used to generate the datasets, we can easily assess how well the algorithm performs the detection and classiﬁcation of the anomaly. Note that this step represents the combined work of every previous algorithm step. Hence, a good accuracy is itself an indicator of the capability of the complete algorithm to ana lyze the onboard data and determine the anomaly or anomalies affecting the RWA. In addition to the accuracy of the diagnos is, we study the impact of the number of bins used in the histogram generation on anomalies related to the FSS. 1) Anomaly classiﬁcation: To determine how accurate the algorithm is at determining the anomaly present in an RWA, we compare its output to the labels in the TAS dataset. Although the algorithm can determine several anomalies at once, assigning a binary label to each one, time-series in the dataset can only have one anomaly at most. We consider the ﬁve possible actual statuses (1 nominal + 4 anomalous), according to the label, and determine in what percentage of the data points with that status the algorithm detected each anomaly. The classiﬁcation step involves training an SVM, done by splitting the dataset into a training set (20% of the datapoi nts) and a validation set (80% of the datapoints). Since this intr o-",
    "and determine in what percentage of the data points with that status the algorithm detected each anomaly. The classiﬁcation step involves training an SVM, done by splitting the dataset into a training set (20% of the datapoi nts) and a validation set (80% of the datapoints). Since this intr o- duces some randomness in the process, we run the training and validation 30 times and show the minimum, mean, and maximum values to verify the stability of the classiﬁcation . The results are shown in Figure 11. Fig. 11. Anomaly detection probabilities obtained with 30 r andom splits of training and validation sets. The top number is the highest, the middle is the mean, and the bottom is the lowest among the 30 tests. Note tha t percentages do not add up to 100%, since the same time-series can be classi ﬁed with multiple anomalies simultaneously. For the four anomalies considered, the probability of them being correctly detected is around 95%. The only exception is JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 14 the FSS 2, which has an accuracy of 100% . Perfect accuracy in the classiﬁcation implies that a separating plane exists be tween the histograms of the friction values of the FSS 2 with and without the anomaly. Another point of consideration is the probability that a datapoint is misclassiﬁed. These probabilities are genera lly low, with the highest number found in the probability that an anomaly in FSS 2 is detected for a datapoint with an anomaly in FSS 1, at 14%. This can be attributed to some confusion in the assignment process, which assigns a changepoint produc ed by one FSS to a different one. Finally, we observe that the differences between the lowest and highest values obtained in different trainings are very small, with the most signiﬁcant variation around 5%. This can be attributed to the simplicity of the SVM, since a small number of tunable hyperparameters reduces the risk of overﬁtting. 2) Number of bins: For the TAS dataset, we used 40 bins to generate the histograms used to classify anomalies of bot h switching systems. To support this decision, we tested diff erent bin numbers ( nbins) and computed the resulting train and validation loss in Figure 12. Fig. 12. Train and validation loss with varying number of bin s for classiﬁ- cation of anomalies of subsystem 1. The plot shows an expected decrease in the train loss as the number of bins increases, since the dimension of the classiﬁcation increases with it. However, many bins lead to overﬁtting, as training captures only the speciﬁc shape of t he datapoints used in training, and the validation loss increa ses. This shows a good level of robustness of the algorithm to the number of bins, which can again be attributed to the use of SVMs for the classiﬁcation. E.

Computation Time We now evaluate the times it takes the algorithm to run on the datapoints of the dataset provided by TAS, each of them containing around 80000 measurements of spin rate and friction. The tests were run on a laptop with an Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 165U. We ﬁrst analyze the time taken by each step of the algorithm to run, together with the total computation time. This resul ts in Figure 13, a violin plot with logarithmic scale to represent the large differences in computation time of the different step s. The classiﬁcation step takes less than 10 ms to run, which makes its contribution negligible. This is to be expected: generating the histograms is relatively cheap, and running an SVM involves little more than an inner product, which makesFig. 13. Distribution of computation time taken by each step of the algorithm, and by the complete algorithm. Each violin plot has 3 horizon tal lines corresponding to the maximum, the mean, and the minimum time s. this step the cheapest to run, with a mean and maximum times of 1 and 10 ms respectively (the variations is due to a higher number of changepoints leading to more values to be included in the histograms). The changepoint detection is t he most expensive step to run, with an average runtime of 100 ms, but its cost has little variation as the computation of th e LLR is done using vector operations. The assignment component exhibits the most interesting behavior: it is fairly cheap on average (around 30 ms to run), but can reach up to 3 seconds in the dataset tested. The observations done on Figure 10 suggest that such increases are related to a high number of changepoints rejected, which were observed to cause an exponential increase in the number of iterations of the algorithm. Although such an increase is very negative for the performance of the whole algorithm, only a very small percentage (around 5%) of the datapoints had more than 3 rejected changepoints. In any cases, the com- putational times are very reasonable given the large number of measurements that each time-series contains, which make s the algorithm suitable to be deployed in the satellite. VI. C ONCLUSION We presented an algorithm to determine the anomaly present in an RWA from a window of measurements of spin rate and friction torque. The algorithm has 4 steps in order to address the peculiarities of the data, dealing with the need to detect changepoints and the properties of each anomaly shown exclusively through a labeled dataset. The results sh ow an overall satisfactory performance of the algorithm, with an accuracy in the detection of anomalies of around 95%. Although the algorithm was developod with the TAS use case in mind, it can be applied to other friction systems that show a jumping behavior in their dry friction coefﬁcient.

Although the algorithm was developod with the TAS use case in mind, it can be applied to other friction systems that show a jumping behavior in their dry friction coefﬁcient. The analysis of the different steps of the algorithm provide s an insight into possible future research on the topic. For instance, the changepoint algorithm could be improved usin g variable window sizes instead of ﬁxed, although this would come at an additional computational cost. The assignment algorithm, although functional, can be improved using an improved algorithm developed for dynamic programming. Another aspect to consider is the need to know the transition JOURNAL OF L ATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 15 functions of the FSS ( Pt s) in order to run the algorithm: auto- matic methods for identifying them would make the algorithm easier to apply to new systems, without the need to manually identify them.
