    "Stabilizability and lower spectral radius for linear switched systems with singular matrices Carl P. Dettmann and Chenmiao Zhang September 23, 2025 Abstract We investigate the stabilizability of linear discrete-time switched systems with singular matri- ces, focusing on the spectral radius in this context. A new lower bound of the stabilizability radius is proposed, which is applicable to any matrix set. Based on this lower bound, more relationships between the stabilizability radius and joint spectral subradius are established. Detailed analysis of the stabilizability radius of a special kind of two-dimensional switched system, consisting of a sin- gular matrix and a rotation matrix, is presented. The Hausdorff dimensions of the parameter sets such that the stabilizability radius of these systems equals a constant are also presented. Other properties of switched systems with singular matrices are also discussed along with examples. 1 Introduction The switched system is widely studied in theory and applications. Let us mention [18] and [19] for comprehensive descriptions of formation and stability of such systems. Ref. [3] contains more recent works on Continuous-Time switched linear systems. There are many aspects of research on switched systems. For example, Ref. [15] consider the control of switched linear systems, the Lyapunov analysis of switched systems considered in [4] and [5] and Ref. [2] is about applications of switched systems to epidemiological spread. Despite the simple form of the system itself, the stability and stabilizability of such systems are hard to determine, even for linear ones. The discrete-time linear switched system of the given matrix setM ⊆Rn×n, n≥2 is given by x(t+ 1) =M σ(t)x(t), x(0) =x 0,(1.1) whereM σ(t)∈ M,σ(t)∈ {1, . . . , m}andmis the cardinality ofM. There are many general results on the stability and stabilizability of such system (for example, see [19]). However, we are not aware of any study focusing on the case where the matrix setMcontains singular matrices. In the literature, the term “singular switched system” refers to a special kind of switched system with many known results (see [20] and [12]), which is different from the one we consider in this paper. To describe the stability and stabilizability of system (1.1), the joint spectral properties are widely used. LetMTdenote the set that contains allM σ(t)···M σ(1), the joint spectral radius of system (1.1) is defined as ˆρ(M) = lim T→∞sup A∈MT∥A∥1/T,(1.2) for any norm. The joint spectral subradius is defined as ˇρ(M) = lim T→∞inf A∈MT∥A∥1/T,(1.3) for any norm. A new radius proposed in [10], called the stabilizability radius, is defined as follows. ˜ρ= sup x0∈Rninf{λ≥0|∃σ(·), c >0s.t.∥x σ(t)∥ ≤cλt∥x0∥∀t≥0},(1.4) These three radii trivially satisfy ˜ρ≤ˇρ≤ˆρand describe different properties of the switched system with different terminology in the literature. In this paper, we have 1arXiv:2509.17799v1 [math.DS] 22 Sep 2025 •A switched system is called stable if ˆρ(M)<1 (see, for example, [8]). •A switched system is called uniformly stabilizable or open loop stabilizable in the literature if ˇρ(M)<1 (see, for example, [8]). •A switched system is called pointwise stabilizable if ˜ρ(M)<1 (proposition 2.5 in [10]). Stanford first showed that pointwise stabilizability is different from uniform stabilizability in [16].",
    "(see, for example, [8]). •A switched system is called uniformly stabilizable or open loop stabilizable in the literature if ˇρ(M)<1 (see, for example, [8]). •A switched system is called pointwise stabilizable if ˜ρ(M)<1 (proposition 2.5 in [10]). Stanford first showed that pointwise stabilizability is different from uniform stabilizability in [16]. The stabilizability radius ˜ρ, first introduced in [10], had many implicit studies beforehand, for example, Ref. [11] considered this problem in measurement scheduling and other cases, and Ref. [7] considered this problem with applications in HIV drug control. For non-singular matrix sets, ˜ρhas been proved to have several lower bounds in [6]. In applications mentioned above, the matrix set could contain singular matrices. In this paper, we have a new lower bound of the stabilizability radius for any finite matrix set. In the meantime, we do a detailed analysis of ˜ρof a two dimensional switched system with singular matrices, and show how to compute the stability radius ˜ρusing continued fractions and Diophantine approximation. We also show that for the case ˜ρ= 0, the set of suchMhas zero Hausdorff dimension. Other properties of systems are mentioned as they appear. Some notations are used in this paper with their well-known meanings. The area denotes then−1 dimensional Lebesgue measure of a set inRn. For two functionsfandg, we writef(x)∼g(x) as x→0 if lim x→0f(x)/g(x) = 1. The notation∥ · ∥will now specifically denote the Euclidean norm in Rn. In section 2, we show the ˜ρis lower bounded by ˇρdivided by the cardinality ofMand give one more situation when ˜ρ= ˇρ. Section 3 is dedicated to the stabilizability radius of the two dimensional switched system with a singular matrix and a rotation matrix. We also show the Hausdorff dimension of the parameter set such that ˜ρ=c,0≤c <1 is zero. Section 4 contains several examples of switched systems with singular matrices about relationship between smallest singular value and ˜ρ. One strategy of finding the optimal switching law is also mentioned. 2 Lower Bound 2.1 Lower bound formation LetA tdenote the productM σ(t)···M σ(1). Supposes2 1(At), . . . , s2 n(At) are ordered eigenvalues ofAT tAt andv 1, . . . , v nare corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors, wheres 1is smallest singular value ofA t. We have two nice properties ofv i. 1.A tviare orthogonal fori= 1, . . . , n. 2.∥A tvi∥=s i(At). Supposes 1, . . . , s κare zero singular values, thenv 1, . . . , v κform an orthonormal basis forKer(A t). Let (x 1, . . . , x n) denote the coordinates ofx∈Rnin terms ofv 1, . . . , v n. Start from the unit sphere. If thetiteration of the unit sphere under anyA tis a subset of a ball centered at the origin, we know that∥x(t)∥ ≤λ∥x 0∥, whereλis the radius of the ball. LetB rdenote the ball with radiusrcentered at the origin andSn−1denote thendimensional unit sphere. We consider the intersection of the pre-image ofA tandSn−1, i.e.S r,At={x∈Sn−1|∥Atx∥ ≤r}. As Atvj= 0 forj= 1, . . . , κ, then for anyx∈S r,At, we have ∥Atx∥2=∥nX i=1xiAtvj∥2=nX i=κ+1s2",
    "whereλis the radius of the ball. LetB rdenote the ball with radiusrcentered at the origin andSn−1denote thendimensional unit sphere. We consider the intersection of the pre-image ofA tandSn−1, i.e.S r,At={x∈Sn−1|∥Atx∥ ≤r}. As Atvj= 0 forj= 1, . . . , κ, then for anyx∈S r,At, we have ∥Atx∥2=∥nX i=1xiAtvj∥2=nX i=κ+1s2 i(At)x2 i≤r2.(2.1) For any nonzeroA t, consider the setS′={x∈Sn−1||xn| ≤r/s n(At)}. Since nX i=κ+1s2 i(At)x2 i≥s2 n(At)x2 n,(2.2) we haveS r,At⊆S′, andS′is a spherical segment. The area ofS′can be obtained using the area of spherical caps. A formula for area of caps is given by Lemma 2.1. 2 Lemma 2.1.((1) in [13])The surface area of the cap of the unit sphereSn−1, i.e.T n(h) ={x∈ Sn−1|x1≥h}withx 1be one of coordinates ofx, is |Tn(h)|=1 2|Sn−1|I\u0012 1−h2;n−1 2,1 2\u0013 ,(2.3) whereI(h;·,·)denotes the regularized incomplete beta function, defined as I(h;a, b) =Rh 0ta−1(1−t)b−1dt R1 0ta−1(1−t)b−1dt,0< h <1.(2.4) A useful equality ofI(h;·,·) is given by I\u0012 h;n−1 2,1 2\u0013 = 1−I\u0012 1−h;1 2,n−1 2\u0013 .(2.5) One can prove this by changing variables in the integral definition ofI(h;·,·). Lemma 2.2.The area ofS r,Atis upper bounded by |Sr,At| ≤ |Sn−1|I\u0012r2 s2n(At);1 2,n−1 2\u0013 .(2.6) For anyt∈N+. Proof.The area ofS′is given by |S′|=|Sn−1| −2 Tn\u0012r sn(At)\u0013 .(2.7) Hence |Sr,At| ≤ |Sn−1|\u0012 1−I\u0012 1−r2 s2n(At);n−1 2,1 2\u0013\u0013 =|Sn−1|I\u0012r2 s2n(At);1 2,n−1 2\u0013 .(2.8) Thus we have a bound of|S r,At|. Theorem 1.The stabilizability radius satisfies ˇρ m≤˜ρ≤ˇρ.(2.9) Proof.The ˜ρ≤ˇρis from definition of ˜ρ. For a givenT, the area of the union ofS r,ATunder allA T have an upper bound given by |∪σSr,AT| ≤X σ|Sr,AT| ≤X σ|Sn−1|I\u0012r2 s2n(AT);1 2,n−1 2\u0013 (2.10) The sum above is over all possible value ofσ(t) fort= 1, . . . , T. SinceI(h,1/2,(n−1)/2) is the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution,I(h,1/2,(n−1)/2) monotonically increases for 0≤h≤1. LetS(T) denotes the smallests n(AT) for allσ, then we have I\u0012r2 s2n(AT);1 2,n−1 2\u0013 ≤I\u0012r2 S(T)2;1 2,n−1 2\u0013 .(2.11) Then [ σSr,AT ≤mT|Sn−1|I\u0012r2 S(T)2;1 2,n−1 2\u0013 .(2.12) From the definition of ˜ρ, for anyλ >˜ρ, there exists a positive constantcsuch that the union ofS cλT,AT covers the unit sphere. Hence |Sn−1|= [ σScλT,AT ≤mT|Sn−1|I\u0012c2λ2T S(T)2;1 2,n−1 2\u0013 .(2.13) 3 Rearranging (2.13), we have a bound ofλgiven by I\u0012c2λ2T S(T)2;1 2,n−1 2\u0013 ≥1 mT.(2.14) Consider the limit lim T→∞S(T)1/T.(2.15) An alternative way to write this limit is lim inf T→∞{sn(AT)1/T|σ(t)∈ {1, . . . , m}, t∈ {1, . . . , T}}.(2.16) Then this is the ˇρof the matrix setM(see for example Theorem 1.1 in [8]). Now, we know the asymptotic behavior ofI(h; 1/2,(n−1)/2) whenhtends to 0, allowing us to obtain a lower bound of ˜ρin terms of ˇρ. Notice that I(h; 1/2,(n−1)/2) =CZh 0t−1 2(1−t)n−3 2dt,(2.17) for a constantC. Letg(x) denote the integrand, then for anyn≥2, we have asx→0, g(x)∼x−1 2.(2.18) Namely,Zh 0g(x)dx∼2√ h.(2.19) Then for large enoughT, we have 2CcλT S(T)≥1 mT,(2.20) which is (2Cc)1/Tλ≥S(T)1/T m.(2.21) LetTtend to infinity, then we have for anyλ >˜ρ, λ≥ˇρ m.(2.22) Letλtend to ˜ρ, then ˜ρ≥ˇρ m.(2.23) In general this is not an accurate bound, especially for largem. Example 2.3.(Based on an example first given in [16]) Switched system withM={M 1, M2}such that M1=\u00121",
    "S(T)≥1 mT,(2.20) which is (2Cc)1/Tλ≥S(T)1/T m.(2.21) LetTtend to infinity, then we have for anyλ >˜ρ, λ≥ˇρ m.(2.22) Letλtend to ˜ρ, then ˜ρ≥ˇρ m.(2.23) In general this is not an accurate bound, especially for largem. Example 2.3.(Based on an example first given in [16]) Switched system withM={M 1, M2}such that M1=\u00121 20 0 2\u0013 , M 2=\u0012cosπ 6−sinπ 6 sinπ 6cosπ 6\u0013 ,(2.24) For Example 2.3, we have ˇρ= 1. From Theorem 1, we know that ˜ρ≥1/2. However, the lower bound given by Theorem 2 in [6] already gives us ˜ρ≥√ 2/2. The advantage of the bound in Theorem 1 is that it works for matrix sets with singular matrices, especially for those system with known ˇρ, while lower bounds in [6] doesn’t work for such matrix sets. Example 2.4.Switched system withM={M 1, M2}such that M1= 1 20 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 , M 2= cosπ 6−sinπ 60 sinπ 6cosπ 60 0 0 1 .(2.25) In Example 2.4,M 1projects any three dimensional vector onto the (x 1, x2) plane. The ˇρ(M) of this system equals the ˇρof Example 2.3. AsM 1is singular, any previous lower bound in the literature doesn’t work for this system. From Theorem 1, we obtain the nontrivial bound ˜ρ≥1/2. 4 2.2 Joint spectral subradius and stabilizability radius From Theorem 1, we know that the stabilizability radius ˜ρis equivalent to the joint spectral subradius ˇρ. An immediate corollary of Theorem 1 is that when ˜ρ= 0, we have ˇρ= 0. This describes the case when a matrix set pointwise converges to zero quickly enough, we know it converges to zero uniformly. Notice that for a givenM, the optimal switching law of ˇρand ˜ρnot necessarily contain every matrix inM. To avoid such phenomena, we have following definition. Definition 2.5.In this paper, a matrix setMis called irreducible if for anyM 1⊂ M, we have ˜ρ(M 1)>˜ρ(M).(2.26) Not all linear discrete time switching systems are irreducible. However, it is sufficient to only consider the stabilizability radius of irreducible matrix sets. This is because an irreducible subset with the same stabilizability radius exists in any reducible matrix set (Corollary 3.4 in [17]). Proposition 2.6.The˜ρ= ˇρif the matrix set is irreducible and contains a singular matrix with one dimensional image. Proof.For this irreducible matrix set, we know that the optimal sequence of ˜ρcontains at least one singular matrix. We can always obtain the optimal sequence of matrices in two steps for such situations. The first step is finding the optimal sequence before applying the singular matrix, and then the second step is finding the optimal sequence starts from the image of the singular matrix. The first part of sequence has no influence on the stabilizability radius, because it doesn’t repeat afterwards. Then it is sufficient to find the optimal sequence only based on vectors in the image of the singular matrix, which have same direction. Consequently, this optimal sequence doesn’t depend on the initial vectors. Corollary 2.7.We have˜ρ= ˇρfor any two dimensional irreducible matrix set with at least one singular matrix. However, for arbitrary matrix set with singular matrices, we don’t have",
    "on vectors in the image of the singular matrix, which have same direction. Consequently, this optimal sequence doesn’t depend on the initial vectors. Corollary 2.7.We have˜ρ= ˇρfor any two dimensional irreducible matrix set with at least one singular matrix. However, for arbitrary matrix set with singular matrices, we don’t have such properties. Consider Example 2.4, we have ˇρ= 1 but this system is pointwise stabilizable as it behaves the same as Example 2.3 (proved in [16]). 3 Two dimensions 3.1 A singular and a rotation matrix Inspired by an Example in [16], we focus on a two dimensional switched system in this section. System 1.Consider a two dimensional switched system with a set of matricesM={M 1, M2}with M1a singular matrix andM 2a rotation matrix, namely M1=\u0012a b c d\u0013 , M 2=\u0012cosαπsinαπ −sinαπcosαπ\u0013 ,(3.1) wherea, b, c, d∈R,ad=bcandα∈(0,1)is the parameter. Letλ 1andλ 2,v1andv 2denote two eigenvalues and eigenvectors ofM 1. Ifλ 1=λ2= 0,M 1is nilpotent, then System 1 becomes trivial. Letλ 2∈R\\ {0}andλ 1= 0. Lemma 3.1.The stabilizability radius of System 1 is given by ˜ρ= inf l∈N λ2sin(lα−β)π sinβπ 1/(l+1) ,(3.2) whereβπ= arccos|⟨v 1, v2⟩|. Proof.To reduce the norm ofx, the general approach is to rotate (applyM 2) as close tov 1as possible, then applyM 1. Consider the switching law in the following general form At=Mtk 2M1Mtk−1 2···M 1Mt1 2,(3.3) 5 wheret i∈N+fori∈2, . . . , k−1,t k, t1∈Nand kX i=1ti+k−1 =t. For any vectorx∈R2, consider the polar coordinates ofx, i.e.x= (r, θπ), we have Mt 2x= (r,(θ−tα)π).(3.4) Without losing generality, we assumev 1is thexaxis, Then we have M1x= (|λ 2rsinθπ sinβπ|, βπ+kπ), k∈Z.(3.5) Notice that after the first time applyingM 1, rotation starts fromv 2andM 2preserves the norm. Let ti=lfori= 2. . . k−1 and∥M 1Mt1 2x∥=C∥x∥, we have ∥xσ,x0(t)∥=|λ 2sin(β−lα)π sinβπ|k−2C∥x 0∥.(3.6) Since the factor of RHS in (3.6) is independent fromx 0, by taking the infimum overlwe obtain the stabilizability radius. To find the infimum in Lemma 3.1, we need to know∥lα−β∥ Nforl∈Nwith∥ · ∥ Nfrom number theory denoting the distance to the closest integer. Now we introduce several lemmas from [1]. The continued fraction ofαis given byα= [a 0;a1, a2, . . .]. Let pk qk= [a 0;a1, . . . , a k] (k≥0),(3.7) andD k=qkα−p k, we have the following results. Lemma 3.2.([1] Lemma (3.1)) For anyα∈R\\Q, we havel∈Nsatisfy that qK≤l < q K+1 for someq Kofα. There exists a unique sequence{c k+1}∞ k=0such that l=∞X k=0ck+1qk.(3.8) wherec k+1satisfy that •ck+1= 0,∀k > K, •0≤c 1< a1and0≤c k+1≤ak+1,∀k≥1, •ck= 0wheneverc k+1=ak+1,∀k≥1. Lemma 3.3.([1] Lemma (3.2)) For anyα∈[0,1)\\Qandθ∈[−α,1−α), there exists a unique integer sequence{b k+1}∞ k=0such that θ=∞X k=0bk+1Dk.(3.9) whereb k+1satisfy that •0≤b 1< a1and0≤b k+1≤ak+1,∀k≥1, •bk= 0wheneverb k+1=ak+1,∀k≥1. Details ofc k+1andb k+1could be found in [1]. 6 Lemma 3.4.([1] Lemma (4.3)) Consider anyα∈[0,1)\\Qandθ∈[−α,1−α), and suppose that ∥lα−θ∥ N>0,∀l∈N.(3.10) There exists a smallest integerk 0such thatc k0+1̸=bk0+1and we define Σ =∞X k=k 0δk+1Dk,(3.11) whereδ k+1=ck+1−bk+1withc k+1andb k+1from Lemma 3.2 and 3.3. Then we have ∥lα−θ∥ N=∥Σ∥ N.(3.12) Then we have the following theorem. Theorem 2.For System 1 with a givenβ, we can obtain the stabilizability",
    "suppose that ∥lα−θ∥ N>0,∀l∈N.(3.10) There exists a smallest integerk 0such thatc k0+1̸=bk0+1and we define Σ =∞X k=k 0δk+1Dk,(3.11) whereδ k+1=ck+1−bk+1withc k+1andb k+1from Lemma 3.2 and 3.3. Then we have ∥lα−θ∥ N=∥Σ∥ N.(3.12) Then we have the following theorem. Theorem 2.For System 1 with a givenβ, we can obtain the stabilizability radius˜ρfor the following three cases. 1. For anyαsuch that∥lα−β∥ N= 0for somel, we have˜ρ= 0. 2. For anyα∈Qand not in case1, letα=p/q, we have ˜ρ= min l λ2sin(lα−β)π sinβπ 1/(l+1) , l∈ {0, . . . , q−1}(3.13) 3. For anyα∈(0,1)\\Qand not in case1, there exists a sequence{l n}∞ n=1such that ˜ρ= inf ln λ2sin(l nα−β)π sinβπ 1/(ln+1) .(3.14) Eachl nis given by ln=nX k=0bk+1qk,(3.15) whereb k+1is obtained from Lemma 3.3 by lettingθ=βwhenα∈(0,1−β), orθ=β−1when α∈[1−β,1). Proof.Case 1 and 2 are easily obtained from Lemma 3.1. For case 3, choosing ln=nX k=0bk+1qk,(3.16) withb k+1from Lemma 3.3 by lettingθ=βwhenα∈(0,1−β), orθ=β−1 whenα∈[1−β,1). Then we haveδ k+1= 0 for allk≤n. Thenl nαis the best approximation ofβfor anyl≤l nby Lemma 3.4, the infimum of ˜ρreached by one ofl nor whenntends to infinity. Remark.The sequence{l n}described in Theorem 2 is non-decreasing and unbounded, but not neces- sarily increasing. It is worth mentioning that ˜ρ= ˇρin this case, as shown in the proof of Lemma 3.1. Then the lower bound from Theorem 1 gives us a trivial inequality ˜ρ≥˜ρ/2. 3.2 Zero stability radius There is one interesting question about System 1: ‘When would ˜ρ= 0?’ For a givenβ, we have the following two cases of ˜ρfor differentα. 1. The infimum is reached by a finitel. 2. The infimum is reached whenntends to infinity. 7 In the first case, ˜ρ= 0 if and only if∥lα−β∥ N= 0 for some integerl. LetL β(0) denotes the set ofα such that the second case holds, it is clear thatL β(0) only contains irrationalα, which all belong to the third case in Theorem 2. The Hausdorff dimension ofL β(0) is given by the following more general lemma. Lemma 3.5.For a givenβand a constantc∈[0,1), letL β(c)be the set ofαsuch that˜ρ=cand the infimum in Lemma 3.1 is reached whenntends to infinity. Then we have thatL β(c)is a zero Hausdorff dimension set. Proof.For eachα∈L β(c), we have ˜ρ= lim inf n→∞ λ2sin(l nα−β)π sinβπ 1/(ln+1) =c,(3.17) with{l n}from the third case in Theorem 2. LetR ndenote∥l nα−β∥ N, as sinx∼xwhenx→0, there exists a infinite subsequence{l ni}such that lim i→∞R1/(lni+1) ni =c.(3.18) Then there exists ac < c 1<1 such that for anyαinL β(c), we haveR ni=o(clni 1) whenitends to infinity. For any 0< s <1 andϵ >0, letL(α) denotes the smallest integer of eachαsatisfy that (a)L(α)∈ {l ni}, (b)∥L(α)α−β∥ N< cL(α) 1, (c)\u0000 t1−scst 1\u0001′|t=(L(α)−1) <0 (d) 2cL(α) 1/L(α)< ϵ, (e) 2s(−slnc 1)s−2Γ(2−s,−slnc 1(L(α)−1))< ϵ, where Γ(a, b) =R∞ bta−1e−tdtis the incomplete gamma function. SuchL(α) exists because Γ(a, b)→0 asb→ ∞. LetL= inf{L(α)|α∈L β(c)}, then for anyα∈L β(c), by (a) and (b), there exists ani such thatl ni>Land ∥lniα−β∥ N< clni 1.(3.19) Then there exists an integerjsuch that α−β+j lni <clni 1 lni,(3.20) Then we have α⊆ β+j lni−clni 1 lni,β+j lni+clni 1 lni! .(3.21) Thel niandjin",
    "Γ(a, b)→0 asb→ ∞. LetL= inf{L(α)|α∈L β(c)}, then for anyα∈L β(c), by (a) and (b), there exists ani such thatl ni>Land ∥lniα−β∥ N< clni 1.(3.19) Then there exists an integerjsuch that α−β+j lni <clni 1 lni,(3.20) Then we have α⊆ β+j lni−clni 1 lni,β+j lni+clni 1 lni! .(3.21) Thel niandjin (3.21) depend onα. LetI(α) denote the interval in (3.21), then we have a cover of Lβ(c) given by Lβ(c)⊆[ α∈L β(c)I(α)⊆∞[ k=Lk−1[ j=0\u0012β+j k−ck 1 k,β+j k+ck 1 k\u0013 .(3.22) LetI(k, j) be thejth interval ofkin 3.22, by (d) we have|I(k, j)|= 2ck 1/k < ϵ. By (c) and (e), we have ∞X k=Lk|I(k, j)|s<2sZ∞ L−1t1−scst 1dt= 2s(−slnc 1)s−2Γ(2−s,−slnc 1(L −1))< ϵ.(3.23) Then for any 0< s <1, the Hausdorff measure ofL β(c) is zero,L β(c) is a zero Hausdorff dimension set. 8 Theorem 3.For a givenβ, letS β(c)be the set ofαsuch that˜ρ=c, thenS β(c)is a zero Hausdorff dimension set. Proof.We have Sβ(c) ={α|∃l,∥lα−β∥ N=c} ∪L β(c).(3.24) For anyl∈N, there are only finiteαsatisfies that∥lα−β∥ N= 0. HenceS β(c) is the union of a countable set and a set with zero Hausdorff dimension. For rationalβ, theαinL β(0) are related to a familiar set of numbers. Proposition 3.6.LetLbe the set of all Liouville numbers in(0,1). For rationalβwe haveL β(0)⊂L. Proof.For every positive integerj, a Liouville numberxsatisfies that there exist integerspandqwith q >1 such that 0<∥x−p q∥N<1 qj.(3.25) Letc 1= 1/2 in Equation (3.19) andβ=p 0/q0. For anyα∈L β(0) and anyj, there exists a sufficiently largeisuch that 2lnilni>(q 0lni)j, i.e. ∥α−p q0lni∥N=1 lni∥lniα−p0 q0∥N<1 2lnilni<1 (q0lni)j,(3.26) for somep∈Z. It is well known that the set of Liouville numbers has zero Hausdorff dimension (see Theorem 2.4 in [14] for example). This result coincides with Lemma 3.5. Lemma 3.5 is also closely related to the finiteness property w.r.t. ˜ρof System 1. For general switched systems, case 1 in the beginning of section 3.2 can be characterized by the following definition. Definition 3.7.A matrix setMhas finiteness property w.r.t.˜ρif there exists a finite matrix sequence At=M σ(t)···M σ(1)such that˜ρtis the spectral radius ofA t. This finiteness property w.r.t. ˆρhas many known results ([9], for example). For system 1 with a givenM 1,∪c∈[0,1) Sβ(c) is the set ofαsuch that this system is pointwise stabilizable.∪ c∈[0,1) Sβ(c)\\ ∪c∈[0,1) Lβ(c) is the set ofαsuch that this system is pointwise stabilizable and has finiteness property w.r.t. ˜ρ. We know eachS β(c) andL β(c) have zero Hausdorff dimension. 3.3 A special case It is helpful to consider a special case of System 1 by lettinga= 2 andb=c=d= 0, i.e the following example Example 3.8.Consider the switched system with the matrix setM={M 1, M2}such that M1=\u00122 0 0 0\u0013 , M 2=\u0012cosαπsinαπ −sinαπcosαπ\u0013 .(3.27) Applying Lemma 3.10 withβ= 1/2, we have Corollary 3.9.The stabilizability radius of Example 3.8 is given by ˜ρ= inf l∈N|2 coslαπ|1/(l+1).(3.28) One vital property of Example 3.8 is that this system is pointwise stabilizable for mostα. Figure 1 shows the ˜ρin terms ofαfor Example 3.8. Each point in figure withαas a sample fromU(0,1) and ˜ρfrom Corollary 3.9. Notice that rationalαwith an even denominator gives us ˜ρ= 0 from Corollary 3.9, so",
    "One vital property of Example 3.8 is that this system is pointwise stabilizable for mostα. Figure 1 shows the ˜ρin terms ofαfor Example 3.8. Each point in figure withαas a sample fromU(0,1) and ˜ρfrom Corollary 3.9. Notice that rationalαwith an even denominator gives us ˜ρ= 0 from Corollary 3.9, so we randomly smapleαin this way to avoid having too many zero values of ˜ρ. Proposition 3.10.For anyα∈(0,1), we have˜ρ≤1and the equality only hold whenα= 1/3or2/3. 9 Figure 1: Stabilizability radius forα∈(0,1) Proof.The Diophantine approximation of Example 3.8 is given byR(α) =∥lα−1/2∥ N. For irrational α,R(α) could be arbitrarily small so there exists anl 0such that∥l 0α−1/2∥ N<1/6. For rationalα, it is known that the smallest nontrivial coprime integer of 2 is 3, so we have R(α)≤R(1/3) =R(2/3), i.e. there existslsuch that ∥lα−1 2∥N≤ ∥l 3−1 2∥N=1 6,∀rationalα∈(0,1).(3.29) Combining the two cases, we haveR(α)≤1/6 for anyα∈(0,1). Then we have ˜ρ≤ 2 sinπ 6 = 1.(3.30) The equality holds if and only ifR(α) = 1/6, i.e.α= 1/3 or 2/3. Then we know for anyα∈(0,1)\\S c∈[0,1)Lβ(c), Example 3.8 has the finiteness property w.r.t. ˜ρ, and eachL β(c) has zero Hausdorff dimension. However the setS c∈[0,1)Lβ(c) is not necessarily a zero Hausdorff dimension set. 4 Some examples From section 3, we know that whenα= 1/3, Example 3.8 is unstabilizable. However, we can obtain a stabilizable system from Example 3.8 by increasing the smallest singular value. Example 4.1.Switched system withM={M 1, M2}similar to an Example in [16] such that M1=\u00122 0 0 1/2\u0013 , M 2=\u0012cosπ/3 sinπ/3 −sinπ/3 cosπ/3\u0013 ,(4.1) Lemma 4.2.Example 4.1 is pointwise stabilizable. Proof.For any initial vectorx 0= (cosθ,sinθ)Twithθ∈[0, π], we have one of following norm is less than 1. •∥A 2A1x0∥. •∥A 2A1A1x0∥. •∥A 2A1A2x0∥. •∥A 2A1A2A1x0∥. 10 •∥A 2A1A1A2x0∥. Figure 2 shows the range ofθsuch that each of the above norm is less than 1. One can obtain the precise range ofθby solving the inequalities that the norm is less than 1, which is not shown here. Figure 2: Norm ofx 0under various matrix combinations Then to make a system stabilizable, we don’t necessarily need the smallest singular value as small as possible. We know that the vector is projected to a lower dimensional subspace after applying a singular matrix. One general way of constructing a optimal sequence is to focus on the movement of the image of singular matrices. For example, after applyingM 2once, Example 3.8 only describes movement of the one dimensional image inR2. For some singular matrices, we can minimize the dimension of the image first. Example 4.3.system withM={M 1, M2}such that M1= 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 , M 2= cosπ 50 sinπ 5 0 1 0 −sinπ 50 cosπ 5 .(4.2) In Example 4.3, the image ofM2 1is a one dimensional subspace and theM2 1have the same largest singular value asM 1. To find the optimal sequence, we can first applyM 1twice to reduce the dimension of the image, then applyM 2to rotate the vector in the image subspace. Sometimes, matrix combinations can be used to reduce the dimension of the image. Example",

To find the optimal sequence, we can first applyM 1twice to reduce the dimension of the image, then applyM 2to rotate the vector in the image subspace. Sometimes, matrix combinations can be used to reduce the dimension of the image. Example 4.4.Switched system withM={M 1, M2, M3}such that M1= 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 , M 2= 1 0 0 0 0−1 0 1 0 , M 3= cosπ 50 sinπ 5 0 1 0 −sinπ 50 cosπ 5 .(4.3) We know the image of the matrix combinationM 1M2M1in Example 4.4 is a one dimensional subspace. To stabilize this system, we can applyM 1M2M1to any initial vectors first. However, maximizing the dimension of kernel by some matrix sequence is not always the best strategy to find the optimal sequence. Example 4.5.Switched system withM={M 1, M2, M3}, M1= 2 0 0 0 01 2 0 0 0 , M 2= 1 0 0 0 0−1 0 1 0 , M 3= cosπ 50 sinπ 5 0 1 0 −sinπ 50 cosπ 5 .(4.4) 11 Using computer programs, it’s easy to check that the optimal sequence does not start with max- imizing the dimension of the kernel, i.e.M2 1. For example, whent= 10, the matrix combination M3M2M1M3M2M3M1M2 3M2has smallest spectral radius. 5 Conclusion In this paper, two different approaches to understand the stabilizability radius of linear discrete time switching systems are presented. First, we showed that in general, the stabilizability radius is lower bounded by the joint spectral subradius divided by the number of matrices. This result leads to more relationships between the stabilizability radius and joint spectral subradius. Then we focused on the two dimensional switched system with a singular matrix and a rotation matrix, in which we presented a method to compute the exact stabilizability radius. The parameter set is a zero Hausdorff dimension set when the stabilizability radius equals a constant, such as 0, are presented using this method. Although most works of linear discrete time switching systems in the literature focus on general results, we presented some examples to show systems with singular matrices are also interesting. The singular matrices function as projections in systems, which could sometimes simplify the optimal sequence of matrices. However, it could also lead to more complex behaviors. For instance, in Example 3.8, the set ofαsuch that the stabilizability radius equals 0 has zero Hausdorff dimension and dense in (0,1). In Example 4.5, we need to consider more matrix combinations to find the optimal sequence. There are still many open questions about the stabilizability radius of linear discrete time switching systems. Such as finding a more precise lower bound of the stabilizability radius, or give more situations when the stabilizability radius equals the joint spectral subradius. In particular, for switched systems with singular matrices, could we find a general method to decide when would stabilizability radius equals zero? Can we say more about the finiteness property w.r.t. the stabilizability radius of System 1 or other systems? Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to",
