    "Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter M. Dey Chowdhury,1,∗J. P. Manley,1, 2, †C. A. Condos,1A. R. Agrawal,1and D. J. Wilson1,‡ 1Wyant College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA 2National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA (Dated: November 12, 2025) Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si3N4-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of 10 n g0/√ Hz over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector’s material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter ﬁeld. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched- ﬁlter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions. Dark matter is one of the enduring scientiﬁc mysteries of our time. Astrophysical observations suggest that an uniden- tiﬁed particle or class of particles accounts for ∼85 % of the Universe’s gravitating matter content; however, their speciﬁc mass and the nature of their coupling to Standard Model (SM) particles remains unknown, despite over 40 years of searching using a variety of direct and indirect techniques [ 1]. Advances in cooling and probing of solid state mechanical oscillators using optical cavities [ 2] have spurred widespread interest in using such cavity optomechanical systems as table- top dark matter (DM) detectors [ 3–10], leveraging compatibil- ity with cryogenics and rapidly maturing techniques that en- able operation at fundamental quantum noise limits. Particle- and wave-like DM detectors have been proposed, based on impulsive [ 11] and continuous [ 12] force measurement proto- cols, respectively. Massive arrays of optomechanical sensors might serve as DM track detectors [ 11,13] or phased antennae arrays [ 14], and have inspired investigation as an application of entanglement-enhanced distributed force sensing [ 15,16]. In this Letter, we describe a search for wavelike, ultralight dark matter (UDM) using a cavity optomechanical system op- erating as an accelerometer. The concept of accelerometer- based UDM detection was introduced by [ 17] and later re- framed as an optomechanical force sensing problem by [ 7, 12]. The basic premise is that DM particles with mass mDM<∼ 10 eV/c2[18] (determined by the local dark matter energy density ρDM) coherently combine to create an oscillating ﬁeld, and that this ﬁeld may act on SM atoms similar to the electro- magnetic force—but with electric charge replaced with a gen- eralized charge such as baryon minus lepton (B-L) number. As such, two free-falling SM objects exposed to UDM would experience a differential acceleration in proportion",
    "an oscillating ﬁeld, and that this ﬁeld may act on SM atoms similar to the electro- magnetic force—but with electric charge replaced with a gen- eralized charge such as baryon minus lepton (B-L) number. As such, two free-falling SM objects exposed to UDM would experience a differential acceleration in proportion to√ρDM and their fractional charge difference ∆12[7,12]: aDM(t)=g∆12a0cos[ωDMt+φDM(t)], (1) where gis an unknown coupling constant, ωDMis the UDM Compton frequency, a0=2.1×1011m/s2[19] is a constant proportional to√ρDM, and φDMis a random phase accountingfor spectral diffusion of DM particles due gravitational inter- action with bodies in our Solar neighborhood. The design of our optomechanical accelerometer was pro- posed in [ 7] and experimentally realized in [ 20], and consists of a pair of Si 3N4membranes with different stiffnesses—a trampoline and a square membrane—vertically integrated on a Si chip, forming a Fabry-Perot cavity. As illustrated in Fig. 1, ﬁxing the cavity to a Cu plate (possessing a larger B-L [neu- tron] density than Si 3N4and Si) translates the UDM signal into an effective chip acceleration aDM. If coincident with the resonance frequency of the trampoline ωm, the acceler- ation gets ampliﬁed by the mechanical quality factor into a displacement xDM=QmaDM/ω2 m[21], yielding sensitivity to UDM with a thermal-noise-equivalent coupling strength of [ 7] g(th)≈/radicalBigg 2kBT mQ mQDMωDM ∆12a0×/parenleftbigg2QDM ωDMτ/parenrightbigg1/4 (2) where Tis the bath temperature, mis the effective mass of the trampoline (accounting for its modeshape and the ﬁnite stiffness of the square membrane [ 7]),QDM∼106[22] is the k1k2 Si-N Si Cua(Cu) DM a(Si,Si-N) DM k1k2 x=a(Cu) DM- a(Si,Si-N) DM=aDM (a) (b) (c) 1 mm FIG. 1.

Equation 2illustrates the desirability of a high m×Qmme- chanical oscillator operated at cryogenic temperatures for sus- tained intervals. To realize a novel sensitivity, [ 7] proposed an ωm∼2π×1 kHz, Qm∼109, cm-scale Si 3N4membrane ( m∼ 1 mg) operating in a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator ( T∼10 mK) for a year ( τ∼107s), enabling g(th) DM∼10−25—two or- ders of magnitude below current constraints set by precision torsion balance tests of the equivalence principle [ 23,24]. Here we report a more modest, ﬁrst generation search for UDM employing a ωm∼2π×10 kHz, Qm∼108, millimeter- scale Si 3N4trampoline ( m∼10 ng) operating in a closed- cycle 4 K cryostat for τ∼103s, targeting g(th) DM∼10−16. Our aim is to demonstrate the working principle behind a cavity optomechanical vector UDM detector, highlighting the chal- lenges of vibration isolation, how to improve signal averaging using radiation pressure feedback cooling, strategies to extend bandwidth exploiting quantum-noise-limited readout and pho- tothermal frequency tuning, and routines for data analysis by template matching to a model for the UDM signal. An overview of our cryogenic apparatus and device char- acterization is shown in Fig. 2. In conceiving such a system, we ﬁrst emphasize the challenging acceleration sensitivity re- quirements implied by current UDM constraints in the “op- tomechanics” band, fDM=ωDM/2π∼1 Hz to 1 MHz. ForB-L UDM, for example, g<∼10−22(see Fig. 4) corresponds to an acceleration sensitivity of√Sa∼ga0∆12/radicalbig ωDM/QDM<∼ ∆12×10−11g0/√ Hz, where g0=9.8 m/s2is Earth’s standard gravity. This sensitivity has been achieved by the Laser In- terferomeric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) at fre- quencies below 1 kHz—indeed, B-L constraints from 100 Hz to 2 kHz currently belong to LIGO—however, at higher fre- quencies, we know of no such reported acceleration sensitiv- ity, including with mechanical oscillators. Challenges include unfavorable thermal noise scaling Sth a=4kBTωm/(mQ m), am- bient vibrations produced by cryostats, and difﬁculty thermal- izing micromechanical resonators to sufﬁciently low T, while at the same time being able to resolve their thermal motion. We adopt a conservative approach and house our detector in a ﬁeld-upgradable Bluefors LD-4K cryostat (LD with the di- lution unit removed) [ 25], using the extra sample volume for a two-foot-long (1 foot = 1 ft. = 30.5 cm) pendulum vibration isolation system (VIS) [ 26] (Fig. 2a). The frequency of the pendulum, fp=0.5 Hz, is ﬁve orders of magnitude below the trampoline’s fm=39 kHz, implying access to an isolation fac- tor of(fm/fp)2∼1010. To mitigate pendulum swing, the ac- celerometer and ﬁber-optic delivery system are assembled and pre-aligned on a small optical bench",

A mechanical ringdown revealed Q=6×107 and a set of thermal noise measurements (see below and [ 19]) conﬁrmed that the device thermalized to the cryostat base tem- perature of 3.5 K, corresponding to/radicalbig Stha=3×10−8g0/√ Hz, using m=12 ng [ 20]. To search for UDM, we analyze acceleration spectra for the presence of a narrow spectral feature with width γDM= ωDM/QDM. Toward this end, Fig. 3shows near-resonance estimates of the trampoline-membrane displacement power spectral density (PSD) Sx[ω]and, by inference, chip accel- eration PSD Sa[ω], using a standard feedback-assisted force sensing protocol [ 20,27–29]. For these measurements, the cavity was probed with a low noise wavelength-tunable (840- 852 nm) diode laser, for displacement readout, and an auxil- iary ﬁxed wavelength (658 nm) diode laser, for radiation pres- sure feedback. The readout laser was tuned to the side of the fringe (Fig. 2e) to maximize sensitivity. The feedback laserwas intensity modulated with a delayed copy of the readout photocurrent to damp the resonance by γ>γDM[30] (Fig. 3a). Periodograms were then averaged for τ=800 s in N=40 intervals of τp=20 s≈10γ−1 DM, calibrated in displacement units using the fringe slope [ 20], and divided by the closed- loop acceleration susceptibility χ[ω]=( ω2−ω2 m+iγωm)−1, yielding an acceleration PSD estimate ˆSa[ω]with an ideal (Gaussian-distributed) mean and standard deviation of Sa[ω]=SDM a[ω]+Sth a+|χ[ω]|−2Simp xand (3a) σˆSa[ω]=Sa[ω]/√ N (3b) respectively, where Simp xis the displacement readout noise (imprecision), and SDM a[ω]is the hypothetical UDM signal.

We also observe photothermal heating at the level of dT/dPout≈ 0.4 K/µW. While anomalously large, this heating enables photothermal tuning of the resonance frequency over 25 Hz (330 DM bins), at the expense of a 3-fold increase in/radicalbig Stha. Our search algorithm [ 19] involves matched-ﬁltering ˆSa[ω] to a model SDM a[ω]=⟨a2 DM⟩GDM[ω], where⟨a2 DM⟩is the un- known UDM acceleration power and GDMis the normalized lineshape (/integraltextGDM[ω]dω/(2π) =1).

Gray dashed line is an extension of the analytical model in (c) assuming a displacement imprecision of Simp x=(5×10−14m/√ Hz)2[19]. Results of the UDM search are summarized in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(a,b), we observe a near-Gaussian dis- tribution of weighted estimators ˆD[ωk]/σˆD[ωk], with vari- ance σ2 ˆD[ωk][19] minimized over the 25 Hz resonant scan window in Fig. 3d. This motivates a likelihood function ρ(ˆD|D)∝exp[(D−ˆD)2/2σ2 ˆD], from which we determine the CL=95 % conﬁdence threshold shown in Fig. 4a. Account- ing for the look-elsewhere effect over a search span of ∆f= 1 kHz ( Nb=τp∆f=104), we observe no detection events. To set a limit on the DM coupling strength, we combine the experimentally determined likelihood function with Bayes theorem and a prior ρ(D)that is uniform for D>0, yielding a median limit DUL≈√ 2σˆDErf−1[CL][19] and a 2 σbound g≤√2DCL a0∆12≈2√σˆD a0∆12(7) for CL=95 %. We consider B-L coupling ( gB−L) as a canon- ical example (reﬂecting its origin as a minimal, anomaly-free gauge extension of the SM [ 36,37]), in which case ∆12= Z1/A1−Z2/A2, where ZiandAiare the atomic and mass num- ber of body i, respectively. For Si 3N4and Si, Z/A≈0.50 and for Cu, Z/A≈0.46, yielding ∆12≈0.04. Using this value presumes that the accelerometer behaves like a heterogeneous mechanical dimer (two bodies made of different material, at-tached by a simple spring) [ 7], as substantiated in [ 19]. Inferred gB−Lconstraints are shown in Fig. 4c, assum- ing a perfectly rigid chip (gray) and correcting for the esti- mated chip response function (red) [ 19]. The lower bound gB−L≈1×10−17corresponds to an acceleration amplitude resolution of√σˆD≈4×10−9g0and PSD resolution of σˆSa(ωDM)≈(2×10−8g0/√ Hz)2, consistent with the vari- ance of the lowest PSD estimate in Fig. 3[19] (at T≈8 K due to photothermal heating). Shown in Fig. 4d is our bound combined with the best current constraints from the Eöt-Wash experiment [ 23,24] and various others at lower frequency. Looking forward, realizing the original design sensitivity gB−L∼10−25[7] requires operating at 10 mK, increasing the cavity ﬁnesse to F=100, increasing the size and Qof the membrane to 10 cm and 109, respectively, vibration isolation at the 10−12g0/√ Hz level, and integrating for a year. Re- cent advances augur well for these upgrades: Sub-100-mK, F>∼104cavity optomechanics experiments with Si 3N4mem- branes have been demonstrated by several groups [ 26]; as have high reﬂectivity photonic crystal (PtC) membranes, in- cluding stable F≈103cavities employing a gradient-pitch PtC [ 38]. Decimeter-scale membranes are now commercially available [ 39], and centimeter-scale PtC membranes [ 40,41] have been realized, driven by the Starshot project. The ex- 5 pected mechanical Qversus size scaling (due to dissipation dilution [ 42]) from 108to 1010has also been conﬁrmed with centimeter-scale Si 3N4beams [ 43]. Finally, low vibration, closed-cycle (continuous operation) dilution refrigerator tech- nology continues to advance in response to the superconduct- ing quantum computing industry, with custom 10−11g0/√ Hz VIS demonstrated for frequencies as low as 10 Hz [ 35].

Finally, low vibration, closed-cycle (continuous operation) dilution refrigerator tech- nology continues to advance in response to the superconduct- ing quantum computing industry, with custom 10−11g0/√ Hz VIS demonstrated for frequencies as low as 10 Hz [ 35]. A key component to realizing novel contraints will be op- timizing the membrane geometry. In-plane patterning can en- able ultrahigh- Q[42], however, a promising alternative is 3D- mass-loading [ 44–46], which can enhance the more relevant Q-mproduct (Eq. 2). Towards this end, we highlight a recent demonstration of m∼0.1 mg, fm∼100 Hz, Qm∼107tor- sion micropendula based on mass-loaded Si 3N4nanoribbons, which achieve Sth a∼10−9g0/√ Hz at room temperature [ 47]. Cryogenically cooled, these devices could reach the desired sensitivity for novel UDM searches in the 10 Hz to 1 kHz band, in conjunction with quantum-limited optical lever mea- surements [ 48,49]; they also provide a route to vibration iso- lation through heterogeneous mass-loading [ 50], the latter of which has been demonstrated using a ﬂip chip approach [ 46]. Finally, we highlight a recent proposal to search for UDM with an array of N=10 cryogenic membrane accelerometers probed by a distributed-squeezed light source [ 16], building on an N=2 demonstration with two 0 .1-mm membranes [ 51]. This approach enables enhanced sensitivity (as much as N- fold [ 16]) if the power per sensor is ﬁxed and, therefore, a route towards improved UDM searches with a cryogenic de- tector limited by photothermal heating or other power con- straints. Loss and scalability are key challenges. Towards this end, an emerging class of photonic-integrated accelerometers [52] and squeezed light sources [ 53] offer a promising route. In the End Matter, we compare various contemporary op- tomechanical accelerometers and their projected performance as B-L UDM detectors, including a second-generation, 1 µg Si3N4trampoline accelerometer described in the SI [ 19], and an emerging class of electromechanical accelerometers based on magnetically levitated test masses, exempliﬁed by the POLONAISE UDM detector [ 35] in Fig. 4. We ﬁnd that several of these systems could in principle reach competitive sensitivity to vector-mediated dark-matter interactions, when operated for extended periods at millikelvin temperatures.

[30] Cold damping does not improve sensitivity [ 28,72], but re- duces nonlinearities and mitigates the effect of spectral diffu- sion over the course of the measurement [ 73], especially rele- vant for high- Qoscillators. [31] The choice of statistical method reﬂects differing priorities: fre- quentism naturally incorporates the look-elsewhere effect when controlling false positive rates (detection threshold); Bayesian analysis incorporates prior knowledge and avoids unphysical outcomes when interpreting null results (upper limits) [ 74].

END MATTER In Table 1 and Fig. 5, we compare various optomechanical accelerometers and their projected performance as B-L UDM detectors, assuming thermal-noise-limited operation at tem- peratures as low as 10 mK. Also included are magnetically levitated systems employing electromechanical readout, in- cluding the POLONAISE [ 35] UDM detector. These include: 1. A 22 mg, 20 cm square Si 3N4membrane as originally proposed in [ 7]. 2. A 0.5 mg, 10 cm version of the membrane in [ 7]. 3. The 12 ng Si 3N4trampoline reported in this work. 4. A 1µg, centimeter-scale “sail” trampoline under explo- ration as the second generation device for our experi- ment. See [ 19] for preliminary experimental results. 5. The 0.4 mg permanent magnet levitated in a supercon- ducting trap, used in the ﬁrst generation POLONAISE UDM experiment [ 35]. The acceleration noise reported in [35] is 100 times higher than projected, highlighting challenging vibration isolation requirements. 6. A 1.8 mg diamagnet levitated in a permanent magnet trap, reported in [ 75]. An alternative to superconducting levitated setups, this system enables low eddy current damping in a levitated diamagnetic platform. 7. A 5.6µg superconducting test mass levitated in a static magnetic trap (superconducting coil) [ 76]. An advan- tage of this magnetic levitation platform is suppression of dissipation from hysteresis and eddy currents. 8. A 0.3 mg, lithographically deﬁned torsion pendulum re- ported in [ 47], formed by suspending a Si microchip from a Si 3N4nanoribbon. An advantage of this plat- form is its arrayability and potential enhanced vibration isolation if heterogenously mass-loaded [ 50,77]. 9. A 95 mg, ﬂipchip mass-loaded Si 3N4trampoline re- cently reported in Ref. [ 46]. An advantage of this plat- form is the potential for heterogenous integration of test masses with high neutron density (e.g., Pt in [ 46]). 10. A 10 mg, dielectric-mirror-loaded Si 3N4trampoline re- ported in Ref. [ 45]. An advantage of this platform is compatibility with integration in to a high ﬁnesse cav- ity, extending thermal-noise-limited bandwidth. 8 Test mass m[µg]ωm/2π[Hz] Qm[106]/radicalbig Stha[ng0/Hz1/2] 300 K 4 K 10 mK(a)300 K 4 K 10 mK(a) 1. 20 cm membrane [ 7] 2 .2×1042×1031036×10−5 2. 10 cm membrane [ 7] 5 .4×1033.8×1031032×10−4 3.

Comparison of optomechanical accelerometer test masses and projected thermal noise at cryogenic temperatures. 11. A 17 mg, photonic-integrated, bulk Si accelerometer re- cently reported in [ 52]. An advantage of this platform is its compatibility with proposals for cryogenic sensor arrays probed with distributed squeezed light [ 16]. 12. A 2.6 g bulk fused silica accelerometer developed for advanced seismic monitoring and space-based geodesy [78]. An advantage of this platform is its technical readiness for satellite deployment [ 80], yielding the possibility of long-baseline UDM detector arrays [ 14]. 13. A 1.1 mg bulk fused silica accelerometer, with a test mass similar in design to device 12 above but with a higher (0.7 kHz) resonance frequency. An advantage of this platform is that it is fully monolithic and enables a high mQ mproduct at relatively high frequencies [ 79]. Projected thermal noise limited sensitivities g(th) B−Lassuming integration times of τ=105s and τ=1 year, and a fractional charge ratio of ∆12=0.04 are shown in Fig. 5, overlaid on the experimental constraint plot in Fig. 4(d). Here we use Eq. 2 (corresponding to a 1-sigma upper limit), which implicitly assumes the test mass has been cold-damped so that γ>∼γDM. We also include projections for an array of N=10 sensors, assuming√ Nenhancement for coherent signal combination limited by (uncorrelated) thermal noise [ 12,16].101100102104103105 fDM [Hz] mDM [eV]10-2410-2010-1610-12 10-28gB-L 10-1310-1410-1210-1110-10213 11 4 10 8 9 7 13 5 6 12current limits from B-L specific searches Projections single device𝜏 = 105 s (� 1 day) 𝜏 = 1 year, 10 mKcurrent parameters 10 mK array of 10 FIG. 5.

Vector UDM Signal We consider a vector DM ﬁeld Aνcoupled to a conserved particle ﬂux density Jν, with a Lagrangian density L=−c2 4FµνFµν+ωDM2 2AνAν−ge√ε0JνAν. (S1) where Fµνis the ﬁeld tensor, and ε0is the vacuum permittiv- ity,eis the electron charge, and cis the speed of light. A. UDM Field Temporal and spectral properties of Aνare determined by the general properties of UDM. For simplicity, we consider only a single spatial component of the ﬁeld Aν→A, corre- sponding to projection of the ﬁeld polarization along the pre- ferred axis of the detector. Following [ 1], we model A(t)as apartially coherent, monochromatic wave1 A(t)≈A0cos(ωDMt+φ(t)) (S2) where ωDMis the Compton frequency and φ(t)is a random phase encoding spectral diffusion due to the Doppler effect. In the frequency domain, the single-sided power spectral density SAcan be expressed as SA[ω]=⟨A2⟩GDM[ω] (S3) where⟨A2⟩is the total ﬁeld power, GDM[ω]is a normalized lineshape (/integraltext∞ 0GDM(ω)dω 2π=1) of the form GDM[ω]=4 γDM√ 2π ee−2(ω−ω′ DM) γDM sinh/radicalbigg 1+4(ω−ω′ DM) γDM(S4a) =4 γDM/radicalbigg 2π ee−2(ω−ωDM) γDM sinh/radicalBig 4(ω−ωDM) γDM(S4b) forω≥ωDM, and GDM[ω]=0 for ω<ωDM, and ω′ DM≡ωDM/parenleftbigg 1+ξ2 DM 2/parenrightbigg ,and γDM≡2ξ2 DMωDM(S5) are the Doppler-shifted Compton frequency and spectral width (approximately full width at half maximum) of the UDM wave, respectively, expressed in terms of its velocity dispersion relative to the speed of light, ξDM∼10−3[1]. The 00-component of the symmetrized stress-energy tensor of the ﬁeld can be shown to be [ 3] T00≈ωDM2AiAi (S6) where indices indicate summation over the spatial compo- nents of the ﬁeld. By equating the estimated local UDM en- ergy density ρDM≈0.4 GeV/cm3[4] with the time-averaged T00, and assuming the ﬁeld polarization is random (relevant for measurements longer than γ−1 DM[5])2, it can be shown that ⟨A2⟩≈ρDM 3ωDM2. (S7) 1Equation S2approximates the ﬁeld amplitude A0as a constant, and is valid for measurement times much smaller than the coherence time, ∼γ−1 DM[2]. Resolving the spectral lineshape (Eq. S4) requires breaking this approxi- mation, but analyzing the signal power ⟨A2⟩remains valid in both cases. 2Speciﬁcally, the factor of 3 in Eq. S7accounts for the average projection of the random ﬁeld polarization onto the preferred detection axis. 2 38.65 38.70 38.7510-6 10-7 -4 -6-20246 -6-4-202468 -2 0 2 4 100101010203040f [kHz] f [kHz]38.65 38.70 38.75 38.65 38.70 38.75 (𝜔 - 𝜔DM)/ߛDM38.65 38.70 38.75 D/ߪD 〉〉√Sa [g0/Hz1/2] Sa - Sa [g02/Hz] � 10-13〉√Sa [g0/Hz1/2] D [g02] � 10-15〉 D ± ߪD 〉D D 〉(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)",

(f) Matched ﬁltering estimates are performed for various simulated signal strengths, demonstrating consistency of the estimation procedure. B. Differential Acceleration Signal Vector UDM with interactions described by Eq. S1will ex- ert a force on particles carrying dark charge—analogous to the electromagnetic Lorentz force. In the non-relativistic limit, it can be shown that the (dark) magnetic contribution to this force is negligible relative to the electric contribution [ 3], such that the force exerted on objects with total dark charge q3is FDM=−qge√ε0dA dt≈gqF 0sin(ωDMt+φ(t)) (S8) where F0=/radicalbig 2ρDMe2/(3ε0)=3.5×10−16N.

UDM Search Data Analysis A simulated UDM search is shown in Fig. S1, mirroring the experimental search presented in Figs 3-4 of the main text. As shown in Fig. S1a and 3c, search data consists of estimates of the differential acceleration ˆS(i) a[ωk]at different Fourier fre- quencies ωkand detector resonance frequencies ω0,i, the lat- ter varied as part of frequency scan. Each estimate is obtained using Bartlett’s method—i.e., averaging Niconsecutive, non- overlapping periodograms of duration τp, corresponding to a resolution bandwidth of ωk−ωk−1=2π/τp. In the absence of 3 a DM signal, the mean and standard deviation of each estimate is ideally ⟨ˆS(i) a(ωk)⟩=S(i) a(ωk)andσˆS(i) a(ωk)=S(i) a(ωk)/√Ni, respectively, where S(i) a(ω)is the true PSD stemming from a combination of thermomechanical and shot noise.

    "estimate is ideally ⟨ˆS(i) a(ωk)⟩=S(i) a(ωk)andσˆS(i) a(ωk)=S(i) a(ωk)/√Ni, respectively, where S(i) a(ω)is the true PSD stemming from a combination of thermomechanical and shot noise. In prac- tice, we ﬁnd that σˆS(i) ais≈30 % larger than ideal, by com- paring each ˆS(i) a(ωk)to a model for S(i) a(ωk)obtained from a Lorentzian ﬁt (main text Fig. 4b). We use these experimen- tally determined values in our DM search, as discussed below. A. DM signal power estimation via matched ﬁltering To search for DM at frequency ωDM, we construct a com- posite estimator for the signal power ⟨a2 DM⟩≡D (S14) that combines matched ﬁltering (over frequency index k) and weighted averaging (over measurement index i): ˆD[ωDM]=σ2 ˆD[ωDM]∑ ikGτp DM[ωk,ωDM] σ2 ˆS(i) a[ωk]/parenleftBig ˆS(i) a[ωk]−S(i) a[ωk]/parenrightBig (S15) where here Gτp DM[ωk,ωDM]≡τp/integraldisplayωk+π/τp ωk−π/τpGDM[ω,ωDM]dω 2π(S16) is the discretized lineshape of the UDM signal (normalized such that ∑kGτp DM[ωk]=τp) and σ2 ˆD(ωDM)= ∑ ik/parenleftBigg Gτp DM[ωk,ωDM] σˆS(i) a(ωk)/parenrightBigg2 −1 (S17) is the estimator variance. For a sufﬁciently large data set, the likelihood function of the DM signal estimator can be approximated as a Gaussian: ρ(ˆD|D)≈e−(ˆD−D)2/(2σ2 ˆD) /radicalBig 2πσ2 ˆD, (S18) We conﬁrmed this experimentally as seen in main text Fig. 4. B. Search for statistically signiﬁcant signals We adopt a frequentist approach to deﬁne a threshold sig- nal power DDTfor DM detection at a conﬁdence level CL. Accounting for the look-elsewhere effect [ 7–9] over a search bandwidth of ∆ω, the threshold is implicitly deﬁned as CL=/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayDDT −∞ρ(ˆD|D=0)dˆD/parenrightbiggNb (S19) where Nb=∆ω/γDMis the number of independent search bins andρ(ˆD|D=0)is the likelihood function under the null hy- pothesis ( D=0). Assuming a Gaussian likelihood function (Eq. S18) yields DDT(ωDM)=√ 2Erf−1{2CL1/Nb−1}σˆD(ωDM).(S20)C. Upper limits on UDM coupling strength We apply a Bayesian framework to set an upper limit DUL on the UDM signal power Dfrom the posterior distribution ρ/parenleftbig D|ˆD/parenrightbig , deﬁned by the condition4 CL=/integraldisplayDUL −∞ρ/parenleftbig D|ˆD/parenrightbig dD. (S21) The posterior distribution is deﬁned by Bayes’ theorem ρ/parenleftbig D|ˆD/parenrightbig =ρ(ˆD|D)ρ(D) ρ/parenleftbigˆD/parenrightbig (S22) where ρ/parenleftbigˆD/parenrightbig ≡/integraldisplay∞ −∞ρ(ˆD|D)ρ(D)dD (S23) is a normalization factor. Noting that the signal power Dmust be positive, we adopt a uniform prior over positive values ρ(D)=/braceleftBigg 0 if D<0 constant if D≥0(S24) This corresponds to Jeffreys prior for a Gaussian likelihood (Eq.

S13, we then deﬁne the coupling strength bound at a conﬁdence level CL as g=√2DUL ∆12a0(S27) D. Analytical approximation for upper bounds An analytical approximation for gULcan be obtained by as- suming a median value ˆD=0, yielding the median constraint Dmed UL=√ 2Erf−1[CL]σˆD≡NCLσˆD (S28) and a 2 σ(CL=0.95,NCL≈2) bound of g(2σ)≈2√σˆD a0∆12(S29) 4Following [ 10], we do not apply the look-elsewhere effect to our limits. 4 Assuming sufﬁcient frequency resolution to resolve the DM lineshape ( γDMτp>1), and that detector noise (thermome- chanical noise and shot noise) is constant over γDM, one can approximate σˆS(i)a[ωk]≈σˆS(i)a[ωDM]≈S(i) a[ωDM]/√Niand σ2 ˆD[ωDM]≈γDM 3τp/parenleftbigg ∑ iNi/parenleftbig S(i) a[ωDM]/parenrightbig2/parenrightbigg−1 (S30) using Eq.

The extra factors of 2 and (2/3)1/4≈0.9 arise from the fact that g(th)is a 1 σconstraint and the deﬁnition of γDMfor lineshape GDM[ω], respectively. III. Experiment A. Vibration isolation Our vibration isolation system (VIS) is based on a similar system described in [ 11]. It consists of four 1 inch-wide (1 inch = 1\" = 25.4 mm), 0.025 inch-thick, 24 inch-long Cu rib- bons from which a miniature optical breadboard (also Cu) is suspended from the cryostat mixing stage, forming a ∼1 Hz pendulum. Photographs of the VIS and breadboard are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) of the main text, respectively; a detailed design is shown in Fig. S2(a). Finite element simulations of the fundamental longitudinal (along the detector axis) and lateral (transverse so the detector axis) pendulum modes are shown in main text Fig. 2(c), exhibiting resonance frequencies ofω0=2π×0.5 Hz and 2 π×16 Hz, respectively. To gener- ate these simulations, we use the Structural Mechanics mod- ule in COMSOL [ 12,13] and assume a rectangular baseplate of mass of 1.6 kg and the dimensions shown in Fig. S2(a). A simulation of the VIS transmissibility Txix[ω]≡|xi[ω]/xb[ω]|along the longitudinal ( x1=x), transverse ( x2=y) and verti- cal (x3=z) directions is shown in Fig. S2(b), assuming base excitation xb(displacement of the mixing stage) along the lon- gitudinal direction. Characteristic Txx[ω≫ω0]∝(ω0/ω)2 isolation is predicted in high- Qlimit, interspersed with mi- nor resonances corresponding to violin modes of the tensioned ribbon suspensions.

Thermalization to cryogenic base temperature In Fig. S3, we present three measurements evidencing ther- malization of the ωm=2π×39 kHz fundamental trampoline mode to the 3 .4 K base temperature of the LD-4K cryostat (as reported by the thermistor on the mixing stage).

These include: (1) [Fig. S3(a)] a displacement PSD estimate com- pared to a thermal noise model; (2) [Fig. S3(b,d)] histograms of the real-time displacement power compared to a Boltzmann distribution, and (3) [Fig. S3(b,c)] energy-autocorrelation measurements used to infer the loaded mechanical damping rate, and thereby the bath temperature, from a cold-damping model. All measurements were carried out with a weak 850 nm probe beam ( Pout=20µW) and no feedback beam, to minimize photothermal heating (see Sec. III.C). Photosig- nals were calibrated in displacement units using the side of the fringe method [ 14]. To compare the apparent bath temperature T0of the tram- poline to the cryostat base temperature, the displacement PSD estimate in Fig. S3(a) is overlaid with a thermal noise model Sx[ω]=|χ[ω,γ]|24kBT0mγ0+|χ[ω,γ]|2 |χ[ω,γ0]|2Simp x (S35a) ≈4kBT0γ0/(γ2mω2 m) 1+4(ω−ωm)2/γ2+Simp x (S35b) where mis the effective mass, γ0is the intrinsic mechanical damping rate and γis the loaded damping rate (accounting for photothermal backaction).

We take this as indirect evidence that T0≈3.4 K, subject to uncertainty in m≈12 ng, which is obtained using a ﬁnite element model for the photolithographically deﬁned trampoline dimensions [ 14], andγ0=2π×0.7 mHz, which we infer from the ringdown measurement shown in Fig. 2(e) of the main text. As shown in Fig. S3(b), simultaneous with the PSD esti- mate in Fig. S3(a), we tracked the instantaneous displacement power⟨x2⟩τ0[15] (corresponding to the area beneath the dis- placement noise peak integrated over a bandwidth τ−1 0such thatωm≫τ−1 0≫γ) for 12 hours using a lock-in ampliﬁer (Zurich Instruments MFLI). A histogram of {⟨x2⟩τ0}is com- pared to the Boltzmann probability distributions p(⟨x2⟩)∝ e−⟨x2⟩/⟨x2⟩in Fig. S3(d), where ⟨x2⟩is the ensemble average power. Quantitative agreement provides further evidence that the oscillator is in a thermal state. From the ensemble average power, the effective temperature of the mode is inferred to be Tmode=⟨x2⟩/(kBmω2 m)=2.4 K. To infer the bath temperature from the modal temperature, we use the cold damping model [ 16] Tmode=T0γ0/γ (S36) and extract the loaded damping rate from an exponential ﬁt to the instantaneous power autocorrelation ⟨⟨x2⟩τ0(t)⟨x2⟩τ0(t+ τ)⟩∝e−γτ[17,18], as shown in Fig. S3(c).

From the ﬁtted value γ=2π×1 mHz, we infer T0=3.5 K, in good agreement with the temperature reported by the mixing stage thermistor.C. Photothermal heating and frequency tuning For measurements shown in Fig. 3 of the main text, the trampoline is subject to photothermal heating (elevation of the bath temperature T0) due to absorption of light from the 850 nm probe beam and 650 nm feedback beam [ 19]. We infer this heating by ﬁtting the feedback-damped, spectrally resolved PSD to the thermal noise model in Eq. S35, using T0as an independent variable. Photothermal heating is used to effect a frequency scan, as shown in Fig. S4(a) (same as inset in Fig. 3(d) of the main text) by varying the probe power, Pout. For this scan, we ﬁxed the mean power in the feedback laser to Pout,fb≈10µW and varied Poutfrom 5µW to 132 µW. A plot of bath temperature (using spectral ﬁtting) versus probe power is shown in Fig. S4(b), exhibiting linear heating with a rate of dT0/dPout≈ 0.4 K/µW. For the smallest probe powers, heating is domi- nated by the feedback beam and the bath temperature was de- termined to be T0=8.3 K (compared to 3.5 K with Pout,fb=0, gray point in Fig. S4(b))—this sets the minimum thermal ac- celeration noise for the data in main text Fig. 3. Finally, we note that the photothermal frequency shift was observed to have a non-trivial dependence on probe-cavity detuning, suggesting a form of cavity-assisted photothermal backaction [ 20]. For the UDM search, we chose to ﬁx the de- tuning to the point of maximum displacement sensitivity (i.e. maximum slope) on the cavity fringe, which coincidentally was found to maximize the photothermal damping. 6 -25-20-15-10-50∆fm [Hz](a) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 14001020304050T0 [K] Pout [W]no fb 3.4 Kfb on 0.4 K/ Wdata - 0.18 Hz/ W (b) (c) 46 5 10 50 10010 8√Sximp [10-14 m/Hz1/2 ] Pout-0.5 scalingmodeldata saturation FIG.

    "main text Fig. 3(c), and [ 14]) by shot noise reduction. In Fig. S4(c), we plot the mean displacement noise ﬂoor as a function of transmitted power Poutover a 1 kHz window from 38.2 to 39.2 kHz (obtained from a ﬁt to the data using Simp xas an independent variable). The P−0.5 out noise scaling shows that the readout was shot-noise limited up to Pout≈100µW. At higher powers, we observe a technical noise ﬂoor of 4 ×10−14m/√ Hz. These measurements were carried out with active intensity noise stabilization [ 21]. In fu-ture experiments, we anticipate that increased intensity feed- back gain (our current limitation) and an active frequency- stabilization will enable lower technical noise. E. Noise averaging: An example As discussed in the main text (Eq. 3) and Sec. II, the standard deviation of the acceleration PSD estimate σˆSa[ω]= Sa[ω]/√ Nreduces as a function of total averaging time τ= Nτp, where τpis the duration of a single time trace (used to produce a periodogram ˆSτp a),Nis the number of time traces (periodograms) averaged to produce ˆSa, and Sais the true PSD. Fig. S5(a) illustrates this scaling for a single repre- sentative measurement ˆSa[ω]with N=50. The gray trace is the moving standard deviation/radicalBig σˆSa[ω]over a 1 Hz window (chosen arbitrarily). The black line is the expected value, with Sainferred from a least-squares ﬁt.

The observed behavior is consistent with demonstrations in [ 14,22] that, for a thermal-noise dom- inated acceleration background, cold-damping can reduce the time necessary to achieve a target noise resolution by a factor ofγ/γ0(≈900 in this case), where γis cold damping rate. f [kHz]10 20 30 40 5010-1 10-2100101Transfer ratio 0.00.51.01.52.0 38.3 38.7 39.1(a) RMS amplitude [V] 10-3 10-410-210-1 (b) (c) 10-3 10-410-210-1RMS amplitude [V]",

Chip rigidity and transfer function The differential acceleration between the two membranes may differ from the lumped-mass model (main text Fig. 1) if the chip is not perfectly rigid. To investigate this discrepancy, we measured the transfer function between the base to which the chip is attached (glued on its four corners) to the inside corner of the chip where the membrane is suspended, emu- lating the mounting geometry of the cryogenic device chip. The setup consists of an auxiliary device chip–which has the same dimensions as the chip used for the UDM search, but no suspended membranes–glued on four corners to a ring-shaped piezoelectric plate transducer (PZT). A Michelson interferom- eter was used to probe the displacement at two positions: (a) near an inside corner of the chip, and (b) directly on the PZT close to the outer corner of the chip where it is glued. The experiment was performed in atmospheric pressure at 300 K, under the assumption that the chip response is similar when operated in a cryogenic, high vacuum environment. (As a fu- ture upgrade, we plan to install a PZT directly onto the sample stage to enable cryogenic chip response measurements.) We deﬁne the chip’s transfer function as rchip(ω)≡|˜aeff(ω)| |˜abase(ω)|=|˜xeff(ω)| |˜xbase(ω)|(S38) where ˜ aeff(ω)[ ˜xeff(ω)] and ˜ abase(ω)[ ˜xbase(ω)] are the effec- tive acceleration [displacement] ˜ aeff(ω)[ ˜xeff(ω)] of the tram- poline test mass and base, respectively, and ωis the excitation frequency. As shown in the inset fo Fig. S6(a), ˜xeff(ω)is measured at the inside corner of the Si chip where the tram- poline would be suspended (red point in panel a). Separately, ˜xbase(ω)is measured directly on the PZT base (with chip ab- sent) near the inside boundary of the PZT where the chip would be in contact with the base (red point in panel b). Response measurements are summarized in Figs. S6. Pan- els (a,b) shows root mean square (RMS) displacement am- plitudes|˜xeff(ω)|and|˜xbase(ω)|at PZT excitation frequency f=ω/(2π), in units of voltage produced by the interferome- ter photodetector. (The interferometer power balance (includ- ing absolute signal and local oscillator powers) and phase, photodetector gain, and PZT excitation power were kept con- stant across all measurements.) The shaded region in each plot shows the standard deviation due to multiple experimen- tal runs. The corresponding estimate of rchip(ω)obtained via Eq. S38, is plotted in panel (c). We ﬁnd that in the 1 kHz window of our UDM search analysis (main text Fig. 4), rchip(ω)∈[0.5,1], indicating the chip is approximately rigid at these frequencies. In our UDM search analysis (Fig. 4 of the main text), we have limited our search bandwidth to a 1 kHz",
    "panel (c). We ﬁnd that in the 1 kHz window of our UDM search analysis (main text Fig. 4), rchip(ω)∈[0.5,1], indicating the chip is approximately rigid at these frequencies. In our UDM search analysis (Fig. 4 of the main text), we have limited our search bandwidth to a 1 kHz window around the trampoline resonance where the chip transfer func- tion is near unity. To compensate for chip compliance, we make the substitution Sa(ω)→Sa(ω)/r2 chip(ω), yielding σˆD→σˆD/r2 chip. The red trace in Fig. 4(c) of the main text highlights this correction using the emperical rchipin Fig. S6(c), while the gray trace assumes rchip=1. 8 IV . Outlook: Optimized devices 1 mm(a) (b) FIG. S7. A comparison of (a) the trampoline test mass used in this paper and (b) a larger trampoline (“sail”) with Bayesian-optimized dimensions to maximize m×Qproduct [ 23]. Both devices are dual- membrane cavities: a square membrane [diagonal beam] constitutes the rigid back mirror in (a) [(b)]. Images are to scale. In future experiments, we plan to use more massive test masses designed to suppress thermal acceleration noise by maximizing the quantity m×Qm/fm. To increase mwithout sacriﬁcing Qmor increasing fm, we have performed Bayesian optimization to enlarge the side length of the trampoline pad [Fig. S7(a)] from 200 µm to 2.5 mm, thereby realizing a “sail”-like test mass [ S7(b)]. The sail—suspended from a 5 mm window as opposed to 2.5 mm for the trampoline—has m≈1.5µg,∼100 times more massive the trampoline. The sail has approximately the same thickness ( <∼100 nm) as the trampoline and slightly wider tethers (10 µm vs. 4µm); ﬁnite element simulations predict Qm≈7×107using a dissipation dilution model [ 24,25]. To date, however, we have observed Qm=2×106experimentally at 300 K and 4 K. Predictions for the sail’s acceleration sensitivity/radicalbig Stha[ω0] at 4 K and 10 mK (dilution refrigerator) temperatures are sum- marized in Table S1—for both predicted as well as empirically observed Qm—and compared against the trampoline. Best es- timates predict a 30-times sensitivity-enhancement vis-à-vis the trampoline, potentially reaching as low as 0 .05 ng0/Hz1/2 at 10 mK. Realizing a novel sensitivity—proposed in Ref.[26] using an idealized ∼10 cm square membrane—would require a further 1000-fold improvement in acceleration sen- sitivity at ∼1-10 kHz; our current efforts focus on releasing larger sails and exploring ways to mass-load the devices.
