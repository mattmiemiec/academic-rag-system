    "Fisher entropic Fokker–Planck model of monatomic rarefied gases Veronica Montanaro, Lukas Netterdon, Manuel Torrilhon and Hossein Gorji Abstract. Particle-based stochastic approximations of the Boltzmann equation are popular tools for simulations of non-equilibrium gas flows, for which the Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations fail to provide accurate description. However, these numerical methods are computationally demanding, especially in the near-continuum regime, where the collisions become overwhelming. On the other hand, the Fokker–Planck kinetic models offer an efficient alternative, as the binary collisions are described by a diffusive process. Despite the intuitive advantage, rigorous and efficient Fokker–Planck approximations of the Boltzmann equation remain an open problem. On one hand, the moment projection of the Fokker–Planck operator should be consistent with that of the Boltzmann operator. On the other hand, the Fokker–Planck model should be constructed in such a way that the H-theorem is satisfied. The central aim of this study is fulfilling these two categorically different constraints, i.e. moment matching and entropy dissipation, within a flexible and tractable Fokker–Planck framework. To this end, we introduce a Fisher information-based entropic constraint and demonstrate that, with a suitable polynomial expansion of the drift term, it is possible to simultaneously achieve weak moment matching while honouring the H-theorem. We support our theoretical result by numerical experiments on the shock problem, validating our Fisher Entropic Fokker–Planck framework. 1.Introduction 1.1.Background Rarefied gas flows appear in a large variety of applications in physics, including atmospheric reentry flights [35], microchannel flows [ 36], and extreme ultraviolet lithography [ 42]. Their simulation is a relevant and active research area, as conventional fluid dynamics simulations based on the Navier– Stokes–Fourier (NSF) equations fail to give an accurate description of such processes [ 25,2,12]. The reason lies in the fact that rarefied gases are often in strong non-equilibrium conditions. This translates to extreme gradients and jumps in the thermodynamic quantities. Therefore, the closure implied by the Linear Response Theory, upon which NSF equations are built, is violated [34, 32]. Date: September 9, 2025. Corresponding author: Veronica Montanaro.

In- stead of following every molecule in the system, as carried out in Molecular Dynamics [ 1], the main idea is to follow the statistical description of the gas kinetics by focusing on the molecu- lar velocity distribution f(v, x, t ).

    "to follow the statistical description of the gas kinetics by focusing on the molecu- lar velocity distribution f(v, x, t ). The latter is linked to the probability of finding a particle at time t∈R+and at a given position x∈R3with velocity v∈R3. In our case we will consider the evolution of a monatomic dilute gas, for which the molecular chaos assumption (also called Stosszahlansatz) holds. For this setting, an accurate description of the evolution of a gas in terms of the evolution of fis given by the Boltzmann equation, which takes into account binary interactions between particles through an integral collision operator. Due to the high-dimensional support of the velocity distribution function fas well as the complexity of the Boltzmann collision integral, simulations based on the Boltzmann equation are prohibitively computationally expensive. To deal with the high-dimensionality, a stochastic approximation based on the Monte Carlo algorithm, called Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), was developed by Bird in the late 1960s [ 7]. The algorithm is consistent with the Boltzmann equation and reproduces experimental results accurately over the whole range of rarefaction. However, since it explicitly performs binary collisions through a jump process, its computational cost scales with the collision frequency. This becomes problematic when approaching the continuum limit, where the number of collisions grows quickly, so the range of application of DSMC remains limited to a specific set of collision frequencies associated with quite large rarefactions. To tackle this problem, simplified particle collision operators have gained attention in the community, trading accuracy with computational efficiency. Diverse classes of stochastic particle methods exist in literature, based on different formulations like the BGK equation [ 6,43], as well as the Fokker–Planck (FP) operators [22, 18, 21, 29, 17]. Within these methods, the Fokker–Planck (FP) model aims to achieve a runtime which is independent of the number of collisions, by approximating the collisions through a drift-diffusion stochastic process. This is in contrast to the BGK model which, despite its simplified form, still employs a jump process whose evaluation needs resolving the collision frequency. The physical motivation behind the FP model has been justified from different perspectives. For example, the Hamiltonian dynamics can be projected onto a resolved particle leading to the Generalized Langevin Equation, as performed in the Mori–Zwanzig formalism [ 11]. Alternatively, in the Kramers–Moyal expansion of the Boltzmann equation, the FP equation can be derived after keeping the first and second order terms [ 33]. Because of its expressive power to describe complex distributions, the FP equation has also been used for diffusion models [26]. Although the design of FP operators has been widely discussed and different models have been proposed, both for monatomic [ 22,18,21,28,17,14] and polyatomic gases [ 15,5,29], there exist still open problems to be addressed in order to unlock the full potential of these methods. In particular, we want to address the open problem of having a FP model which obtains correct transport prop- erties along with honoring the H-theorem.

    "the full potential of these methods. In particular, we want to address the open problem of having a FP model which obtains correct transport prop- erties along with honoring the H-theorem. The theorem, which is a fundamental property of gases following the Boltzmann equation, states that the evolution of the entropy functional has always a negative sign until the equilibrium distribution is attained. Therefore satisfaction of the H-theorem FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 3 imposes a requirement on the kinetic models, for their consistency with the Boltzmann dynamics. In practice, it has also been observed that the H-theorem consistency has direct impact on the accurate recovery of shock profiles [ 18,17], its absence in the FP model leads to overly diffusive shock structures. One notable study to enforce the H-theorem within nonlinear-drift Fokker–Planck models is the En- tropic Fokker-Planck (EFP) framework [ 17]. In this formulation, the consistency with the H-theorem is ensured by constructing an explicit coupling between diffusion and drift coefficients. However, the resulting entropy dissipation rate lacked a clear dynamical structure: although the decay of entropy was guaranteed in sign, its evolution was not governed by a well-defined functional form. Following this study, beyond the sign of the entropy evolution, having a well-defined rate of entropy evolution turned out to be also important for shock profiles. Specifically, the decay rate proportional to the Fisher information with respect to the equilibrium distribution turned out to give high-fidelity results [17]. Motivated by these theoretical and empirical results, we present in this paper a novel framework which honors the entropy decay proportional to the Fisher information, which we will refer to as Fisher Entropic decay rate. Our model, which we will call Fisher Entropic Fokker–Planck (FE-FP), has the advantages of bringing together the H-theorem constraint and correct relaxation rates of non-equilibrium moments, while maintaining the simplicity of implementation of the previous models. 1.2.Contributions and organisation The main contributions are summarized in the following. •Entropy constraint via Fisher information.We introduce a Fisher-information based constraint on the FP model that enforces the H-theorem with a well-defined decay rate. •Well-posedness of model coefficients.We establish well-posedness of the linear systems underlying the model coefficients subject to the combined entropy and moment-matching constraints. •Efficient algorithm and validation.We demonstrate close agreement with DSMC and clear improvements over the cubic-drift FP model in shock-structure problem. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.

The ℓp(Rn)norm of x, forp∈N/ 0, is defined as ∥x∥p:=(P i|xi|p)1/p. For a multi-index α= (α1, ..., α n)T∈Nn, we refer to the length as |α|:=Pn i=1αiand define the monomialsxα:= Πn i=1xαi i. Furthermore let In r:={α∈Nn:|α|⩽r}(1) be the set of multi-indices with order less than r. Therefore a polynomial of degree less than r canbedescribedasP α∈Inrcαxαwithrealcoefficient cα. Wedenoteby |In r|thecardinalityoftheset In r. We denote the velocity by v∈R3and spatial position by x∈ D, where D ⊆R3. Moreover, we denote by{H α(v)} α∈I3ra set of linearly independent polynomials of the velocity. Suppose ˆf(v|x, t)is the density of a probability distribution over the velocity space, and let ∆(R3):=\u001a ˆf(v|x, t) :R3× D ×R⩾0→R⩾0 Z R3ˆf(v|x, t)dv= 1,∀(x, t)∈ D ×R⩾0\u001b . (2) We refer to the scaled probability density f(v, x, t ) =ρ(x, t)ˆf(v|x, t )as the velocity distribution, where ρ(x, t) =n(x, t)mis the gas density, with molecular mass mand number density n(x, t). We denote the moments by m(p) α(f, x, t) :=⟨vα∥v∥p 2, f⟩(3) where⟨p, q⟩=R R3pq dv. We also refer to central moments as ˜ m(p) α(f, x, t) :=D\u0010 v−m(0) 1/ρ\u0011α v−m(0) 1/ρ p 2, fE .(4) We indicate random variables by capital letters and assume that they belong to the Hilbert space H=L2(Ω,A, P ), with the sample spaceΩ, the σ−algebra Aon sub-sets ofΩ, and the law P FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 5 as a function from Ato[0,1]. The space includes square-integrable A-measurable functions on Ω. A random process Xtis a random function in Hindexed by time t⩾0. In particular, we useMt, Xt: Ω−→R3for the stochastic processes corresponding to velocity and spatial position, respectively. We refer to the pairs {(M(i) t, X(i) t)}i∈[1,N], which are initialized as Ni.i.d. samples and evolve according to given stochastic processes, as particles.

We refer to the pairs {(M(i) t, X(i) t)}i∈[1,N], which are initialized as Ni.i.d. samples and evolve according to given stochastic processes, as particles. We estimate the velocity moments at a given position and time as the following. Consider Dto be discretized into non-overlapping cells as ∪jS(x(j)), where x(j)is the spatial coordinate of the center of the cell S(x(j)). We employ the Monte Carlo numerical estimation of the conditional expectation E[F(Mt)|Xt=x(j)], with F:R3→Rda smooth function, as ˆE(NS)[F(M t)|Xt=x(j)]:=1 NSX X(i) t∈S(x(j))F(M(i) t),(5) where NSis the number of particles in S(x(j)). Note that for notational simplicity, we often drop x(j) in the conditional expectation. 2.2.Review of Fokker–Planck models The Boltzmann equation for the evolution of fin the monatomic dilute gas setting (in the absence of external force) reads ∂f ∂t+v·∇ xf=SBoltz[f],(6) whereSBoltz[f]is the operator describing the binary collisions of the particles SBoltz[f] =Z R3×S2B(|v−u|,cos ˆω) (f(v∗)f(u∗)−f(v)f(u))du dˆσ.(7) Here( u, v)and( u∗, v∗)are the velocities of the colliding pairs pre and post collisions, B:R3× [−1,1]−→R+is the collision kernel, ˆωis the deflection angle, and dˆσis the infinitesimal solid angle [8]. For notation simplicity, we omitted the dependency on xandt. To conclude, it is im- portant to mention that the moments of fgive information on the macroscopic quantities of the gas. We can compute the density asm(0) 0, the mean velocity as Ui= m(0) i/ρand the temperature as T=˜ m(2) 0/(3nkB). In the latter, we have kBas the Boltzmann constant. For notational convenience, we refer to the quantity θ=kBT/m =˜ m(2) 0/(3ρ)as well. The other relevant physical quantities depending on the moments are the scalar pressure p=˜ m(2) 0/3, the pressure tensorΠ ij=˜ m(0) ij, the stress tensor σij= Π ij−1/3pδijand the heat-fluxes qi=˜ m(2) i/2. Finally, we refer to the viscosity µ=µ0(T/T 0)ω, where ωdepends on the underlying molecular model, T0= 273K and µ0the viscosity evaluated atT 0. Approximating the Boltzmann operator with a simplified diffusion operator, leading to the FP equation, dates back to the works of Kirkwood [ 24], Lebowitz et al. [ 27], and Pawula [ 31]. Based on the theory of Brownian motion, these studies presented a heuristic approach to obtain a diffusive approximation of the Boltzmann collision operator. In general such approximations can be cast in an FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 6 operator of the form SFP[f] =−∇ v·(A[f](t, v)f) + ∆ v,v(D[f](t, v)f).(8) where A[f](t, v) : ∆(R3)×[0,∞)×R3→R3andD[f](t, v) : ∆(R3)×[0,∞)×R3→R3⊗R3. We often drop the explicit dependency on tandvand refer to A[f]as the drift functional and D[f]as the diffusion functional. 2.2.1.Linear-drift FP The original diffusive approximation of the linear Boltzmann equation from [ 24] and [31] led to a formulation with a drift which is linear with respect to the (molecular) velocity and a diffusion proportional to the temperature. In the context of simulation of monatomic rarefied gases, Jenny et al. [22] were the first ones to adopt this formulation. The resulting operator takes the form of SFP[f] =∇ v·\u0000 v′/τ f\u0001 + ∆ v,v(θ/τ f),(9) where A[f] =−v′/τ(10) and D[f] =θ/τ ,(11) where v′=v−Uis the fluctuating velocity. Here,",

The resulting operator takes the form of SFP[f] =∇ v·\u0000 v′/τ f\u0001 + ∆ v,v(θ/τ f),(9) where A[f] =−v′/τ(10) and D[f] =θ/τ ,(11) where v′=v−Uis the fluctuating velocity. Here, τ= 2µ/pis a time scale. This model formulation leads to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of McKean-Vlasov-type (since UandTdepend on f). The linear-drift FP satisfies conservation of mass, momentum and energy, and recovers the correct viscosity in the hydrodynamic limit. This implies correct relaxation rate for the stress tensor σ. However, the model has a major shortcoming: it fails to recover the correct relaxation rate for the heat-fluxes q. This leads to a wrong Prandtl number and thus a wrong heat conductivity in the hydrodynamic limit [22]. 2.2.2.Cubic-drift FP In the following years, FP methods with correct heat-flux relaxation have been proposed for monatomic [18,28] and polyatomic gases [ 29]. In order to fulfill consistent relaxation of moments beyond the stress tensor, a fully non-linear model of the drift was postulated in [ 18]. In particular, the diffusion D[f] =θ/τ(12) maintains the form of the linear-drift model, andA[f]now has a cubic form given by Ai[f](v′) =−1 τv′ i+3X j=1cij[f]v′ j+γi[f] 3X j=1v′ jv′ j−3θ + Λ[f] v′ i3X j=1v′ jv′ j−2qi ρ , (13) where τhas the same form as for the linear model, c[f]∈R3×3is a symmetric tensor, γ[f]∈R3 is a vector, andΛ[ f]is a scalar. WhileΛ[ f]was introduced as a stability term, c[f]and γ[f]are FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 7 updated at every timestep through a linear system of equations. The system is constructed using weak consistency with the Boltzmann operator as a constraint, i.e. ⟨Hα(v′), SFP[f]⟩!=⟨H α(v′), SBoltz[f]⟩,∀α∈I3 α.(14) In the case of the cubic-drift (13),{Hα(v′)}α∈I3α={1, v′,∥v′∥2 2, v′⊗v′−1/3tr(v′), v′∥v′∥2 2}. The objective is to enforce the projection of the FP collision operator on a given set of polynomials to be similar to that resulting from the Boltzmann operator ∀t∈R⩾0. For this reason, the weak consistency is also known in the community as“moment matching”. This enforces both conservation laws through the moments of1 , v′,∥v′∥2 2and, in addition to linear-drift FP, the relaxation rates of higher-order moments (up to the heat-fluxes). This model is the state-of-the-art for FP model thanks to the simplicity of its formulation, as well as flexibility on the moments matched. We have to notice that despite the simplicity of its implementation and its moment consistency property, the cubic-drift model has no guarantee on the structure of the entropy dynamics and its relaxation rate towards the equilibrium. As a consequence, the model can be prone to diffusive shock profiles in numerical experiments [18, 17]. 2.2.3.FP models with alternative structures It is worthwhile to mention that there exists two alternative structures of FP models which can address the issue of entropy relaxation encountered by the cubic-drift FP model. The first one, introduced by Mathiaud and Mieussens [ 28], leverages the anisotropic diffusion coefficient inspired by the elliptic BGK model [ 43]. Despite the entropy consistency, the moment",
    "exists two alternative structures of FP models which can address the issue of entropy relaxation encountered by the cubic-drift FP model. The first one, introduced by Mathiaud and Mieussens [ 28], leverages the anisotropic diffusion coefficient inspired by the elliptic BGK model [ 43]. Despite the entropy consistency, the moment consistency could not be enforced globally as the diffusion coefficient might become negative for specific non-equilibrium conditions. Another result was derived in [ 17], where a scalar diffusion was constructed ensuring consistency with the Boltzmann H-theorem. The improvement over the cubic-drift model, however, remained limited due to the fact that the entropy relaxation rate could not be controlled. 3.Problem statement and main idea 3.1.H-theorem Considering the Boltzmann equation in a homogeneous setting (6)without the gradient term on the left-hand side, it can be shown that the equilibrium is given by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution f0=ρ (2πθ)3/2exp −∥v′∥2 2 2θ! .(15) The H-theorem characterizes the evolution offtowardsf 0via the entropy functional H[f] =⟨f,logf⟩,(16) stating that ∂H[f] ∂t⩽0,(17) with equality ∂H[f]/∂t= 0if and only if f=f0. This is an important property of the Boltzmann equation, whose physical interpretation gives rise to irreversibility of the kinetic system, giving FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 8 an “arrow of time\" towards the equilibrium, which corresponds to the minimum entropy H[f0] = ⟨f0,logf 0⟩[38]. Moreover, existenceof L1andKullback-Leiblerboundswithrespecttotheequilibrium can be proved based on contraction ofH[f][40]. 3.2.Problem statement Given the importance of the H-theorem in Boltzmann kinetics, it is highly desirable to devise FP models admitting this constraint. In particular, theoretical results on the trend to equilibrium in terms of entropy bounds of (8) have been shown in [4, 3, 39]. In practice, admitting the H-theorem has important impact on the ability of the model to accurately recover the shock profiles [18, 17]. In the following, we translate the H-theorem to a model constraint for a generic FP opera- tor. Considering the homogeneous setting, the evolution of H[f]following the FP equation (8)and assumingD[f]to be independent ofv, we get ∂H[f] ∂t=⟨−∇ vA[f]−D[f] (∇ vlogf·∇ vlogf), f⟩.(18) The open question is how to choose A[f]and D[f]such that ∂tH[f]follows the constraints given by the Boltzmann H-theorem, and at the same time we keep enough flexibility to fulfill the weak consistency relationship (14) for an arbitrary set of moments. 3.3.Main idea Considering the linear-drift FP model, a key insight can be gained. By using A[f](10),D[f](11) from the operator (9) into the expression (18) we find ∂H[f] ∂t=−θ τ* ∇vlogf f0·∇vlogf f0, f+ ,(19) where the integral term on the right-hand-side is the Fisher information I(f|f0) = ⟨∇vlogf/f 0·∇vlogf/f 0, f⟩[13]. The quantity I(f|f0)represents a distance between two prob- ability distributions fandf0. Because of its quadratic form, it is always ⩾0with equality iff f=f0. Since T >0, then(17)holds and the H-theorem is verified. This formulation is particularly favorable, as it is consistent with the theoretical analysis of FP equations, as seen in [ 39]. Moreover it was observed that fulfilling the equality (19)leads to better recovery of shock profiles with respect to other rates [ 17]. However, we remind that despite this nice",
    "This formulation is particularly favorable, as it is consistent with the theoretical analysis of FP equations, as seen in [ 39]. Moreover it was observed that fulfilling the equality (19)leads to better recovery of shock profiles with respect to other rates [ 17]. However, we remind that despite this nice property, the linear-drift FP model does not give correct heat-conductivity, as shown in Sec. 2.2.1. Therefore the main idea of our Fisher Entropic FP model is to bring together the entropy evolution (19)and the weak consistency relation (14) in the construct of drift and diffusion coefficients of the FP model. 4.Entropy guided Fokker–Planck by Fisher information This section is dedicated to discuss in detail the FE-FP framework. Closures of the diffusion and drift functionals, as well as important theoretical results on the model, will be covered. The general ansatz for the drift will be introduced in Sec. 4.1. The novel entropy constraint will be discussed in Sec. 4.2. The moment consistency relations will be then derived in Sec. 4.3. We will then proceed to FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 9 Sec. 4.4 to show how to include both constraints into a linear system for which there exists a unique solution. Finally, we will go through the time scale derivation in Sec. 4.5 and conclude by analyzing the underlying SDE in Sec. 4.6. 4.1.General formulation We start sketching our model by constructing Aas a gradient field which, without loss of generality, can becastasanexpansionaroundthelineardrift. Supposewewouldliketomatchthemomentsassociated with polynomials {Hα(v′)}α∈I3r. Consider {Hα(v′)}α∈I3r∪ ∥v′∥2k 2, where2 k=r+ 2−mod (r,2). The augmented set of polynomials now include the smallest even power, larger than the highest order of moments which are going to be matched. We refer to the augmented index set by ˆI3 2kand the corresponding polynomials by {Hα(v′)}α∈ˆI3 2k. LetΦ(r)[f](v′)be a potential function corresponding to the polynomial expansion, given by Φ(r)[f](v′):=X α∈ˆI3 2kcα[f]H α(v′)(20) with{c α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2kbeing a set of real coefficients. We consider the following drift ansatz A[f](v′) =−1 τv′+AHO[f](v′)−c d[f]∇ v(∥v′∥d 2),(21) comprising of linear, nonlinear, and stabilizing term, where AHO[f](v′) =∇ vΦ(r)[f](v′),(22) contains all higher order terms in v′, up to the order r. Note that τ >0is a time scale independent ofvthatwillbefixedlater. Thediffusioniskeptwiththesameformulationastheoneexpressedin (12). The purpose of the stabilizing term −cd[f]∇v∥v′∥d 2is to ensure that the drift can be ex- pressed as a gradient of a convex function as ∥v′∥2→ ∞. This leads to regularity of the solution of the corresponding SDE (as justified in Sec. 4.6). We choose cd[f]⩾0(with equality at equilibrium), where d= 2k+ 2is the closest even number strictly larger than2 k. Furthermore, as we would like to recover the linear drift model in the limit of thermal equilibrium, the coefficient cd[f]should depend on some notion of non-equilibrium moments. We set cd[f]in terms of θ0and a small empirical parameterϵ 0≈10−3as cd[f] =ϵ 0p (2θ0)r ˜ m(r) 0(f)−˜ m(r) 0(f0) 2 2. ˜ m(r) 0(f0) 2 2.(23) The idea, following the one for the cubic-drift formulation of Sec. 2.2.2, is to design a linear system of equations for{c α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2ksuch that moment consistency and entropy production are both",

By carrying out the calculation as in (18), we arrive to the following result (the proof is deferred to Sec. 5.1). FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 10 Theorem 4.1(Fisher entropic constraint).Suppose f(v, t)(with H[f]<∞) is the solution of the FP equation ∂ ∂tf=SFP[f],(24) for some fixed initial condition, where the right-hand-side is given by (8), the drift follows (21), and the diffusion is set to (12). Also for simplicity (and without loss of generality) ρ= 1.

Note that the time scale τ, introduced in D[f], controls the entropy relaxation rate. While well-posedness and convergence to equilibrium of the FE-FP system remains out of the scope of the current study, we emphasize that the Fisher entropic structure imposed by (26)leads to an upper bound on the L1-distance of ffrom f0as shown for non-linear FP equations in [4]. 4.3.Weak consistency After deriving the entropy constraint of our FE-FP model, we move on to the moment equations resulting from the weak consistency constraints (14). An important result regarding relaxation of non-equilibrium moments according to the Boltzmann equation (assuming molecules with the Maxwell potential) is the theorem of the trend to equilibrium [41], recalled below. Consider an arbitrary (regardless of whether it is central) moment of the form ⟨Hα(v′), f⟩, whose evolution is governed by the homogeneous Boltzmann equation leading to ∂ ∂t⟨Hα(v′), f⟩=D Hα(v′), SBoltz[f]E =:P α[f],(28) whereP α[f]is called the production term forH α(v′). Then we have the following result. Theorem 4.2(trend to equilibrium).Every moment following ODE (28)is analytic function of time which relaxes exponentially to its equilibrium value. FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 11 For the proof, see the reference text [ 41]. The consequence of this theorem is that the system of equations constructed from the constraint (14)is closed for any order of moments. Following this theoretical result, we insert the FP operator (8)with drift (21)and diffusion (12)in the left-hand side of (14), leading to * ∇vHα(v′)·X β∈I3rcβ[f]∇ vHβ(v′), f+ =P α[f] +g α(τ, D[f], c d[f]),∀α∈I3 r.

The construction requires special caution, though, since it is not always guaranteed that the matrix obtained from combiningΦ(r)[f](v′)with the constraints is invertible. Therefore, in order to obtain a well-posed system we proceed with the following procedure. (1)We split the model coefficients {cα[f]}α∈ˆI3 2kinto two sets of coefficients, and derive the potential spanned by them. (2)We show that by enforcing the model constraints on the new coefficients, two well-posed linear systems are obtained. This procedure will be such that the existence of a unique solution is ensured, with a minimal additional computation of the two sets of model coefficients. Letφ:=α2k,l:=|ˆI3 2k|and note that |I3 r|=l−1. Furthermore, consider the matrix R[f]∈Rl×lwith elements Rαβ[f] =⟨∇ vHα(v′)∇vHβ(v′), f⟩,(31) and the vectorQ[f]∈Rl, Qα[f] =⟨∆ v,vHα(v′), f⟩(32) withα, β∈ ˆI3 2k. Additionally, letG[f]∈Rlbe a vector of zeros except for the last term Gφ[f] =−2Q φ[f].(33) Let us introduce{c′ α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2kand{ˆc α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2k, from which{c α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2kare computed cα[f]:=c′ α[f] +c′ φ[f] ˆc α[f],∀α∈I3 r cφ[f]:=c′ φ[f] ˆc φ[f].(34) FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 12 Accordingly, an equivalent formulation of the drift can be obtained by ˜Φ(r)[f](v′) =X α∈I3rc′ α[f]H α(v′) +c′ φ[f]X α∈ˆI3 2kˆcα[f]H α(v′),(35) leading to ∇vΦ(r)[f](v′) =∇v˜Φ(r)[f](v′). It is now left to drive, and to show the invertibility of, the linear system of equations for {c′ α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2kand{ˆcα[f]}α∈ˆI3 2k, fulfilling moment and entropy constraints. We set ˆc[f]:=R[f]−1(Q[f] +G[f]),(36) noting that R[f]is invertible as shown in Appendix A. Next, we identify {c′ α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2k, by plugging the potential ˜Φ(r)[f](v′)in the moment and entropy constraints, and substituting {ˆcα[f]} α∈ˆI3 2kwith its solution (36). We obtain c′[f] =L[f]−1b[f](37) with L[f] = ¯R[f] ¯Q[f] ¯Q[f]TS[f]! andb[f] = b[f] h[f]! ,(38) where the composition of L[f]and b[f]is given in the following. ¯R[f]∈Rl−1×l−1is the sub-matrix of R[f]excluding the row {Rφβ[f]}β∈ˆI3 2kand the column {Rαφ[f]}α∈ˆI3 2k. In the same way, ¯Q[f]∈Rl−1 is the sub-vector ofQexcluding its last elementQ φ[f]. Furthermore, we have the scalar S[f] =X α∈ˆI3 2kˆcα[f]Q α[f] =X α,β∈ ˆI3 2kRαβ[f]−1Qα[f](Q β[f] +G β[f]) =X α,β∈ ˆI3 2kRαβ[f]−1Qα[f]Q β[f]−2Q φ[f]X α,β∈ ˆI3 2kRφα[f]−1Qβ[f].(39) The right-hand-side vector is comprised of bα[f] =P α[f] +g α(τ, D[f], c d[f]), α∈I3 r (40) containing the weak consistency right-hand-side, and h[f] =−c d[f]⟨∥v′∥2k 2, f⟩,(41) the entropy constraint right-hand-side. With these elements set, we have the following result. Theorem 4.3(linear systems solution).The linear systems given by (36)and(37)always admit a unique solution as long as temperature is positive i.e.T >0. The proof is deferred to Sec. 5.2. Since both linear systems for {c′ α[f]}α∈ˆI3 2kand{ˆcα[f]}α∈ˆI3 2khave a unique solution, then the coefficients {cα[f]}α∈ˆI3 2kare uniquely identified through (34), resulting in a drift fulfilling both moment and entropy constraints.",

FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 13 4.5.Time scale derivation The model will be closed once we fix the time scale τ >0. Note that irrespective of the value of the time scale, the model fulfills the entropy and moment constraints. Our derivation of τwill be guided by the fact that it controls the entropy decay rate. In particular, we aim for a value of τsuch that the entropy decay rate implied by the FE-FP model is identical to the one resulting from the Boltzmann equation for a known class of distributions. In order to do that, we limit our analysis to the case for which an analytical solution can be obtained in time. We focus on the relaxation of elliptic (anisotropic-Gaussian) distributions of the form fG=ρ (2π)3/2√ det Πexp −1 2X i,jv′ iΠ−1 ijv′ j .(42) To simplify the derivation, and without loss of generality, we perform the calculation on a frame of reference in whichΠis diagonal with components λ1,λ2andλ3= 3−λ1−λ2, assuming that θ= 1 andρ= 1. We derive the entropy decay rate for each of the operators ∂HBoltz[fG] ∂t= 1,∂ ∂t(fGlogf G) ,(43) ∂HFE−FP[fG] ∂t=−1 τ* ∇vlog fG f0! ·∇vlog fG f0! , fG+ .(44) The former, given by (43), follows 1,∂ ∂t(fGlogf G) =* ∂fG ∂t,1 + logf G+ =3X i=1∂λi ∂t* ∂fG ∂λi,1 + logf G+ =−p 2µ3X i=1 1 λi−1! ,(45) where we used the fact that ∂tΠ =∂tσ=−(p/µ)σfor interaction of Maxwell molecules governed by the Boltzmann equation. On the other hand, the entropy decay rate given by (44) follows −1 τ* ∇vlog fG f0! ∇vlog fG f0! , fG+ =−1 τ3X i=1 1 λi−1!2 λi.(46) Enforcing equality between the two entropy decay rates leads to τ=2µ p3X i=1(1/λ i−1)2λi (1/λ i−1)=2µ p.(47) FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 14 4.6.Well-posedeness of corresponding SDEs Following standard results in theory of stochastic processes, it is straight-forward to derive the Langevin SDEs corresponding to the FP equation given by (8). Specifically, we have dMt,i=A i[f]dt+p 2D[f]dW t,i,(48) dXt,i=M t,idt,(49) where Wt: Ω→R3is the Wiener process. For our FE-FP setting, the system belongs to a family of SDEs known as McKean-Vlasov (MKV) SDEs, for which the evolution of the stochastic processes depend also on the distribution f(here through moments of f)[30,9]. It is easy to see that in our case, this dependency is a direct consequence of the dependency on the moments for A[f]and D[f]. This carries additional challenges compared to classical SDEs. In particular, it is more complex to prove bounds on stability and results on well-posedness. It is out of the scope of the paper to prove regularity of our SDE in the general MKV setting .

    "is more complex to prove bounds on stability and results on well-posedness. It is out of the scope of the paper to prove regularity of our SDE in the general MKV setting . Instead, we focus on regularity of the velocity SDE with frozen model coefficients. In particular, we assume the coefficients {cα}α∈ˆI3 2kas well as the diffusionDto be constant in time. For this setting, we have the following theoretical result. Theorem 4.4(SDE regularity).Let us consider the velocity SDE (48), corresponding to the FP equation (8)with diffusion (12)and drift defined as (21), with {cα}α∈ˆI3 2kbounded and constant in time, and stabilization coefficient cd⩾0defined as (23). Then, the velocity SDE admits a unique solution global in time. The proof is deferred to Sec. 5.3. 5.Justifications of theoretical results We present in this section the proofs of the theorems justifying our theoretical results on FE-FP. Only for this section, for notation simplicity and without loss of generality, we adopt the following assumptions. (1) We set⟨v, f⟩= 0, such thatv′=v. (2) We setρ= 1. From this point onwards, we suppress the explicit dependence on ffor notational convenience, unless required for clarity. 5.1.Proof of Fisher entropic constraint theorem (Theorem 4.1) Proof.The proof follows from the evaluation of (18). For the drift given by (21) we find ∂H ∂t=3 τ− ⟨∇ vAHO(v), f⟩+c d⟨∆v,v∥v∥d 2, f⟩ −θ τ⟨∇vlogf·∇ vlogf, f⟩ =−θ τI(f|f 0)− ⟨∇ vAHO(v), f⟩+c d⟨∆v,v∥v∥d 2, f⟩(50) FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 15 using integration by part and direct calculation. The constraint (26)leads to cancellation of the second and the third term on the right-hand-side, and thus ∂H ∂t=−θ τI(f|f 0).(51) □ 5.2.Proof of linear systems solution theorem (Theorem 4.3) Proof.First, note that for the system (36), the proof is straight-forward as Ris symmetric positive definite (see Appendix A for details). Next, for the solution uniqueness of (37), we need to prove that Lis invertible. The idea is to use the block construction of Land prove invertibility through Sylvester’s criterion. Since Ris symmetric positive definite, and thus invertible as previously mentioned, we can compute the determinant ofLvia the Schur complement of ¯R L/¯R=S− ¯QT¯R−1¯Q.(52) Note that ¯QT¯R−1¯Q=X α,β∈I3rR−1 αβQβQα =X α,β∈ ˆI3 2kR−1 αβQβQα−X α∈ˆI3 2kR−1 φβQβQφ−X α∈I3rR−1 φαQφQα =X α,β∈ ˆI3 2kR−1 αβQβQα−2Q φX α∈ˆI3 2kR−1 αφQα+R−1 φφQφQφ =S+R−1 φφQφQφ.(53) Therefore L/¯R=−R−1 φφQφQφ.(54) However the right hand side is strictly negative and therefore the system always admits a unique solution, due to the following. (1)Note that Qφ=⟨∆v,v(∥v∥2k 2), f⟩and therefore Qφ>0since ⟨∥v∥2 2, f⟩> 0(due to positivity of temperature). (2) We haveR−1 φφ>0by observing R−1 φφ=⟨∇ v(∥v∥2k 2)·∇ v(∥v∥2k 2), f⟩.(55) □ 5.3.Proof of SDE regularity (Theorem 4.4) Proof.The proof follows Theorem 3.5 by Khasminskii in [ 23]. Given the fact that for fixed model coefficients, the drift is only function of vand the diffusion is a constant, the conditions of the FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 16 mentioned theorem on drift and diffusion are fulfilled.

We are left with identifying a Lyupanov functionV(v)which behaves like a convex function as∥v∥ 2→ ∞, and satisfies LV(v)⩽aV(v),(56) where Lis the generator of the SDE and a <∞is some constant. In our case, we set V(v) =∥v∥2 2. We observe that as ∥v∥ −→ ∞ , the stability term (23)becomes dominant, as ∥v∥d 2has a higher order than any other polynomial inAHO(v), and goes to−∞faster than any other term leading to −A(v)·∇ vV(v) +p 2θ/τ∆ v,vV(v)⩽aV(v),(57) for some constanta >0.□ 6.Solution algorithm For practical rarefied gas flow simulations, we need to deal with the three-dimensional velocity space, where the moment consistency includes the stress tensor and the heat-fluxes. This leads to correct viscosity and heat-conductivity in the hydrodynamic limit. In this section, we present a computationally affordable numerical recipe for the FE-FP operator built on this setting. 6.1.Model expression In order to consider the moment consistency for the momentum, the stress tensor, and the heat-fluxes, we let {Hα(v′)}α∈ˆI3 4={1, v′, v′⊗v′−1/3tr(v′), v′∥v′∥2 2,∥v′∥4 2}(note that the energy conservation is included through the trace of the stress tensor). With this set of polynomials we have the following expression for the drift Ai(v′) =−1 τv′ i+AHO i(v′)−c(4)v′ i∥v′∥4 2,(58) where AHO i(v′) =c(0) i+3X j=1\u0010 (c(1) ij+c(1) ji)v′ j+ 2c(2) jv′ iv′ j\u0011 +c(2) i∥v′∥2 2+ 3c(3)v′ i∥v∥2 2.(59) For convenience we define the symmetric tensor ˜c(1) ij=c(1) ij+c(1) ji. Note that c(4)⩾0,|c(4)| ≪1is fixed as the stabilization term (see (23)). The remaining coefficients are {c(0),˜c(1), c(2), c(3)}, which depend on fthrough its moments. The vector c(0)∈R3can be readily computed from the momentum conservation c(0) i=−3θc(2) i−3X j=1 2Πijc(2) j+ 6qi ρc(3)! +∆i ρc(4),(60) with∆ i=˜ m(4) i. The linear system is then constructed for the symmetric tensor ˜c(1)∈R3×3, the vectorc(2)∈R3, and the scalarc(3)∈Rleading to10×10system. FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 17 6.2.Linear system setup Following Sec. 4.4, we obtain the unknowns by solving the two linear systems (36)and(37)of size 10×10. The explicit expressions of the system matrices R,Q,GandL(using the naming introduced in Sec. 4.4), as well as the one for the right-hand side vector, can be found in Appendix B. To reduce the cost of inversion of the matrix L, we calculate L−1through its Schur complement (which we have shown in Sec. 5.2 to be the scalarL/ ¯R= ¯R−1 10,10Q10Q10) L−1= ¯R−1−(L/ ¯R)−1¯R−1QTQ¯R−1−¯R−1¯QT(L/¯R)−1 (L/¯R)−1Q¯R−1(L/¯R)−1! ,(61) and we get ¯R−1by applying the Sherman-Morrison formula [ 37] toR−1. In this way, we reduce the computation of the linear system to only one10 ×10matrix inversion, substituting the second inversion with less costly operations. 6.3.Moment estimation Since we pursue a particle based approach, the moments of fare estimated based on the particle samples.

Moreover we estimate the central momentsm(p) αwith the corresponding Monte Carlo estimator for conditional expectations ofM′(i) n=M(i) n−ˆE(N)[Mn|Xn=x]. 6.4.Time integration We discretize the McKean-Vlasov processes (48)and(49)in time, resulting in the approximation of the system of particles at {tn}for a given time-step size∆ t=tn+1−tn. Let us denote the approximations at time tnby subscript nand let sn= ∆t/τn. Moreover, let {ξ(i)}be i.i.d. standard normal variates. To evolve( M(i) n, X(i) n)7−→(M(i) n+1, X(i) n+1), we employ the split-step time integration scheme from [18], with the half-step M(i) n+1/2=\u0000 e−sn+sn\u0001 M′(i) n+A(i) n∆t+s Dnτn 2(1−e−2sn)ξ(i),(63) and the final velocity update M(i) n+1 =ε nM(i) n+1/2+ˆE(N)[Mn|Xn=x],(64) whereε nis the energy scaling factor εn=ˆE(N)\u0002 ∥Mn+1/2∥2 2 Xn=x\u0003 ˆE(N)\u0002 ∥Mn∥2 2 Xn=x\u0003.(65) Note that in the case of frozen coefficients, the presented scheme ensures conservation of momentum and energy during the velocity update and becomes effectively the Euler-Maruyama scheme as sn→0.

The physical domain is discretized with a computational grid and at every iteration of the algorithm, particles are mapped to a computational cell according to their position. Since moments are evaluated conditionally on the position, they are computed cell-wise, as described in step 9. Therefore, two main data structures are needed: one for the grid containing information on the moment estimates and drift coefficients, and another one for the particles, with every particle storing its position and velocity. Step 13 is used for post processing and typically requires a separate data structure.

    "DSMC [7] is provided. The setting chosen for validation of the FE-FP model is a supersonic flow of argon (modeled as hard sphere gas) over an infinitely thin plate [17]. FISHER ENTROPIC FOKKER–PLANCK MODEL OF MONATOMIC RAREFIED GASES 19 A fully diffusive isothermal plate of reference length Lrefand temperature Treflies at the center of a rectangular domain of size Lx1×Lx2with Lx1= 2.5LrefandLx2= 3Lref, where the gas with initial number density n0is at equilibrium with temperature T0=Tref, initially. Calculating the reference time scale τref= 2µ0/p0from the initial viscosity µ0=µ(T0)and pressure p0=n0kBT0. We choose the Knudsen number Kn= 0.14for the length Lref/2and the hard-sphere mean-free-path λ. The supersonic flow enters through the left boundary resulting in a shock around the plate. For hard sphere gas, the viscosity law isµ(T) =µ(T 0)p T/T 0. The computational grid is comprised of120 ×120cells for discretization of physical space with the horizontal and vertical coordinates of x1andx2, respectively. The initial number of computational particles is3 ×106. The timestep is chosen fine enough such that the benchmark DSMC calculations are accurate, leading to∆ t= 1.3876×10−2τref. To reach steady state, the simulation is run for2 ,000time-steps, and additional5 ,000time-steps are used to average the macroscopic quanti- ties. Because of the x2-axis symmetry of the problem, only the upper half of the domain is simulated where symmetric boundary condition is applied on x2= 0line. For the open-boundaries including both outflow and inflow boundary conditions, we use the technique described by Bird in [ 7], while particles leaving the domain are deleted from the simulation. The simulation is repeated for upstream Mach number Ma= [4,5,6,7]. The FE-FP model setting is the one described in Sec. 6. Mo- ments matching up until heat-fluxes are imposed for hard sphere production terms as described in [ 20]. The shock profile at steady state, visualized through Mach contours, is shown in Fig. 1. Very good agreement on the shock profile is shown between the DSMC reference solution and FE-FP for the whole range of Mach numbers. On the other hand, the cubic-drift FP shows a diffusive behavior that progressively gets more evident as the Mach number increases. For better visualization, in Fig. 2 we depict the temperature profiles with respect to x1by slicing the domain atx2= 1.875Lref, slightly above the plate. The agreement with the DSMC solution is further confirmed there. Despite the overall close agreement between FE–FP and DSMC results, we note a visible deviation in the shock downstream region. These discrepancies are expected in zones characterized by large local Knudsen numbers, where non-equilibrium effects can extend beyond those captured by moment matching up to the heat-fluxes. We anticipate that augmenting the FE–FP framework with higher-order moment constraints would help diminish this gap and further improve the accuracy of shock-structure predictions in such regimes. 8.Conclusion and final remarks Kinetic models have attained growing attention as an active area of research, bridging interacting particle systems with macroscopic continuum descriptions in fields ranging from rarefied gas dynamics to plasma physics and data-driven modeling.

    "and final remarks Kinetic models have attained growing attention as an active area of research, bridging interacting particle systems with macroscopic continuum descriptions in fields ranging from rarefied gas dynamics to plasma physics and data-driven modeling. Among these, the FP equation offers a particularly attractive formulation, arising as the diffusive approximation of the Boltzmann equation in regimes where collisions are overwhelming. Yet, even in the classical setting of a monatomic dilute gas, the rigorous derivation of such approximations remains an open challenge.

Our study addresses this problem by introducing the FE-FP equation. The model brings together a consistent moment projection of the Boltzmann equation with an entropy-decay mechanism with favorable structure. The formulation is both analytically tractable and computationally affordable, requiring only marginal computational overhead compared to standard FP models. We provide theoretical justifications for the basic aspects of the model, including the entropy decay and the well-posedness of linear system underlying the model coefficients. The framework is also validated by numerical results on shock waves confirming the role of correct entropy production in shock profiles, showing close agreement with respect to the high-fidelity solution of the Boltzmann equation.

Following this path, the FE-FP model can be employed to build cascades of FP models, extending the application range of FP models to simulations of multiscale problems. More broadly, the proposed framework provides a path to building SDE models constrained by both moment conditions and entropy laws, with potential applications extending beyond kinetic theory to areas such as diffusion-based generative modeling and the Schrödinger bridge problem [19].

    "Lunati for providing laboratory infrastructure, computational resources, and insightful feedback, and Prof. Fabio Nobile for his valuable comments on the study. Reproducibility of computational results Code and data that allow readers to reproduce the results in this paper are available at https: //codeberg.org/vmontanaro/StochasticFP. AppendixA.Positive defineteness ofR[f] Consider an arbitrary non-zeroz∈Rl. We have X α,β∈ ˆI3 2kzαRαβ[f]zβ=* X α∈ˆI3 2kzα∇vHα(v)  · X β∈ˆI3 2kzβ∇vHβ(v) , f+ =* X α∈ˆI3 2kzα∇vHα(v) 2 , f+ .(67) The right-hand side is clearly non-negative, so we only need to check whetherP α∈ˆI3 2kzα∇vHα(v) = 0. This is prevented due to the linear independence of {Hα(v)}α∈ˆI3 2kpolynomials (by construct). Therefore the summation is strictly positive for all z∈Rl. Besides the fact that R[f]is symmetric, this concludes the proof thatR[f]is symmetric positive definite. AppendixB.Three-dimensional linear system matrix Here we provide the elements of matrices and vectors for the linear system corresponding to the model coefficients of Sec. 6.1. To simplify notation, we drop the dependency on fand leave it implied for the rest of the appendix. Moreover, we use the naming R, Qandbas defined in Sec. 4.4.
