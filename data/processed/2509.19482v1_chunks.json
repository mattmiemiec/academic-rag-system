Banner appropriate to article type will appear here in typeset article A self-consistent numerical model of internal wave-induced mean flow oscillations in polar geometry Florentin Daniel1and Daniel Lecoanet1,2 1Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA), Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA 2Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA Corresponding author:F. Daniel, florentin.daniel@northwestern.edu (Received xx; revised xx; accepted xx) The Earth’s Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a natural example of wave-mean flow interaction and corresponds to the alternating directions of winds in the equatorial stratosphere. It is due to internal gravity waves (IGW) generated in the underlying convective troposphere. In stars, a similar situation is predicted to occur, with the interaction of a stably-stratified radiative zone and a convective zone. In this context, we investigate the dynamics of this reversing mean flow by modelling a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core in polar geometry. Here, the coupling between the two zones is achieved self-consistently, and IGW generated through convection lead to the formation of a reversing azimuthal mean flow in the upper layer. We characterise the mean-flow oscillations by their periods, velocity amplitudes, and regularity. Despite a continuous broad spectrum of IGW, our work show good qualitative agreement with the monochromatic model of Plumb & McEwan (1978). If the latter was originally developed in the context of the Earth’s QBO, our study could prove relevant for its stellar counterpart in massive stars, which host convective cores and radiative envelopes. 1. Introduction Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD) exhibits numerous examples where strong spatial and temporal separation of scales lead to rich nonlinear behaviours. Among them, the reversals of winds between eastern and western directions in the Earth’s stratosphere is one of the most striking. Known as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), it was first quantitatively measured in the early 1960s (Ebdon 1960; Reedet al.1961). Due to the internal gravity waves (IGW) induced by convective motions in the underlying troposphere, a downward pattern of zonal winds is generated through the alternating deposit of angular momentum by prograde and retrograde waves. Subsequent measurements Abstract must not spill onto p.20X0-1arXiv:2509.19482v1 [astro-ph.SR] 23 Sep 2025 F. Daniel and D. Lecoanet showed the period of the flow to be of 28 months in average, leading to its name (Baldwin et al.2001). It is much longer than the typical period of the waves which is of a few days. Earth is not the only illustration of such a phenomenon. Jupiter also displays similar reversals, the Quasi-Quadrennial Oscillation with a period of approximately 54 months (Leovyet al.1991), and Saturn with a period of 14.8 years, where it is related to the planet seasonal forcing (Ortonet al.2008). The three planetary oscillations mentioned here are all equatorially confined. In stars, there is a similar situation necessary for QBO, with a stably-stratified layer— the radiative zone (RZ)—which is adjacent to a convectively unstable one—the convective zone (CZ). This has led the community to posit the existence of the same type of behaviour, known as shear-layer oscillations (Kumaret al.1999; Charbonnel &",
    "stars, there is a similar situation necessary for QBO, with a stably-stratified layer— the radiative zone (RZ)—which is adjacent to a convectively unstable one—the convective zone (CZ). This has led the community to posit the existence of the same type of behaviour, known as shear-layer oscillations (Kumaret al.1999; Charbonnel & Talon 2005; Fuller et al.2014). However, such shear-layer oscillations have yet to be observed. While wave-driven mean flow oscillations in GAFD arise from the interplay between convective motions and stably-stratified layers, early works managed to capture the oscillations only modelling the stably-stratified layer. Plumb (1977) and Plumb & McEwan (1978) introduced a one-dimensional model accounting for the evolution of the mean flow excited by two monochromatic waves with opposite phase velocities (see§3 for more details). Their work, which was corroborated in a laboratory experiment, sparked considerable interest in the atmospheric sciences community, as the model proved to be able to reproduce many qualitative features of the QBO (e.g. Wedi & Smolarkiewicz 2006; Renaudet al.2019), being besides a source of rich nonlinear behaviours. Yoden & Holton (1988) indeed showed, through numerical integration of the Plumb and McEwan model, that the mean flow follows the behaviour of a Hopf bifurcation when the amplitude of the waves is changed. This was later confirmed by Seminet al.(2018) via a weakly non linear analysis of the system (see also Semin & P ´etrelis 2024). Transitions to chaos were also found (Kim & MacGregor 2001). While these one-dimensional models have had success in representing certain aspects of the QBO, many researchers have developed more complex models to address new observations of QBO disruptions, as well as make predictions of similar behaviours in other planets and stars. In the atmospheric sciences community, Saravanan (1990) for instance took into account several waves (see also L ´eardet al.(2020) or Chartrandet al. (2024) more recently). Stochastic wave excitation has also been considered (Ewetola & Esler 2024). In the astrophysical community, the one-dimensional models have been applied to stellar parameters (Talonet al.2002; Talon & Charbonnel 2003), and have also been extended to include additional physical effects. Kim & MacGregor (2003) for instance included the influence of magnetic fields and applied their calculations to the Sun. The sophistication of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) led to the development of global models, where contrary to Plumb and McEwan, the action of the CZ is resolved self-consistently and not through any form of parameterisation. In the context of massive stars, Rogerset al.(2012) and Rogerset al.(2013) reported the development of a mean flow in the RZ. The authors attributed its development to the continuous spectrum of IGW generated by the CZ, but did not observe any reversals. The first study to indeed observe an oscillating mean flow while explicitly solving for the dynamics of the two zones was conducted by Coustonet al.(2018-a) in a 2D Cartesian geometry. Adopting a model where the thermal expansion coefficient of the modelled fluid differs in the two zones (see Coustonet al.(2017) and§2), they were able to generate periodic reversals of the mean flow.

While the initial motivation of Coustonet al.(2018-a) came from the context of laboratory experiments where the nonlinear equation of state of fresh water allows for such mixed layer dynamics, it is the goal of the present paper to extend their model to polar geometry, as a model of the equatorial slice of a star. Being able to thoroughly understand the complex interplay between the two zones with DNS is of the utmost importance to motivate future closure models for stellar evolution codes. A direct stellar application could be for instance to compare the CZ statistics of our work to the parameterised one used by Showmanet al.(2019) for Brown Dwarfs oscillations. A better understanding of the mechanism behind wave-driven mean flow oscillations can also be applied to other geophysical and astrophysical contexts (see Bardetet al.2022 for the case of Saturn). The organisation of this paper is as follows. We first introduce our numerical model in §2. As our numerical model has many similarities to the Plumb and McEwan model, we recall in§3 the main characteristics of their work for completeness, adapted to our setup, and refer to the original study. We present results in§4. We detail the waves generated by the CZ (§4.1) and then present properties of the mean flow—its period and typical velocity—in§4.2. Implications of our study as well as directions for future works are discussed in§5. 2. Methods We study a 2D non-rotating fluid in a disk of radiuse𝑟 𝑜. The fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations: 0X0-3 F. Daniel and D.

We model the mixed dynamics of a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core, similar to the geometry of a massive star. Several methods exist in order to account for the coupled dynamics of both a convective zone (CZ) and a radiative zone (RZ). For example, one can impose a background density gradient changing sign at the interface between the two regions (see, e.g., Aubert (2025) in the geodynamo context). Here, we follow the description of Coustonet al.(2017). Originally motivated by the behaviour of water whose density peaks at 4◦C in laboratory conditions (see for instance Vallis (2017)), we impose that the density variations be piecewise linear as a function of temperature, f𝛿𝜌 e𝜌0(e𝑇)=( 𝑆g𝛼𝐶𝑍e𝑇,e𝑇≤e𝑇𝑖, −g𝛼𝐶𝑍e𝑇,e𝑇≥e𝑇𝑖.(2.4) In line with the typical Boussinesq approximation, we only take into account the density variations f𝛿𝜌with respect to the background density of the fluide𝜌 0in the buoyancy force. Equation (2.4) models the associated change of sign of the thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid, leading to two different behaviours: below the inversion temperature, e𝑇𝑖, the flow is stably stratified, and above the inversion temperature the flow is convectively unstable. In the stellar context, this simulates a change from heat transfer by thermal convection in the core to heat transfer by radiative diffusion of photons in the envelope.𝑆is the stiffness parameter controlling the amplitude of stable stratification of the RZ via the Brunt-V ¨ais¨al¨a frequency e𝑁2=−𝑆g𝛼𝐶𝑍e𝑔(e𝑟)𝜕g𝑇𝑅𝑍 𝜕e𝑟,(2.5) whereg𝛼𝐶𝑍is the thermal expansion coefficient of the CZ. This is illustrated in Figure 1a, where the core, whose temperature is above e𝑇𝑖is more active than the envelope. High values of𝑆tend to circularise the interface, as convective plumes are prevented from penetrating the strongly-stratified medium (Coustonet al.2017). Convection is triggered through a volumetric heat source e𝑄(e𝑟)= f𝑄0𝑒−(e𝑟/f𝑟 𝑏)2. Its Gaussian shape peaking in the centre represents the action of nuclear reactions inside the star, similar to earlier studies in the same geometry (Rogerset al.2013). In what follows, we sete𝑟𝑏=0.1e𝑟𝑜. While varyinge𝑟 𝑏would undeniably change the properties of the CZ quantitatively, we have made sure to choose it small compared to the interface radiuse𝑟 𝑖(see after and Appendix A), in order for internal heating and turbulence to be contained in the CZ only (see Figure 1b). It is their action that generates the propagation of internal gravity waves (IGW) in the RZ. We include a damping layer in the outer portion of the domain to 0X0-4 Focus on Fluids articles must not exceed this page length Journal of Fluid Mechanics prevent wave reflection with profile𝐷(e𝑟)=\u0010 1+tanh((e𝑟−e𝑟 𝑑)/e𝛿)\u0011 /2. Following Couston et al.(2018-a), we work withe𝑟 𝑑=0.9e𝑟𝑜,e𝛿=0.02e𝑟𝑜. We discuss the properties of this damping layer in§5. We non-dimensionalise the equations with e𝑇0=e𝑇𝑠(0)−e𝑇𝑠(e𝑟𝑠 𝑖),e𝑟𝑜,e𝑡0=\u0010 e𝑟𝑜/g𝛼𝐶𝑍f𝑔𝑜e𝑇0\u00111/2 andf𝑝 0=e𝜌 0e𝑟𝑜2/e𝑡02respectively as temperature, length, time, and pressure scales, and write each variable as e𝑋=f𝑋0𝑋with𝑋dimensionless.

Equation (2.4) is rewritten as𝑓=( f𝛿𝜌/e𝜌 0)/g𝛼𝐶𝑍e𝑇. The integral𝐼 𝑟𝑏depends only on the geometry of the internal heating profile, and is expressed in Appendix A. The dimensionless parameters controlling the behaviour of (2.6-2.8) are 𝑅𝑎=g𝛼𝐶𝑍f𝑔𝑜e𝑇0e𝑟𝑜3 e𝜈e𝜅, 𝑃𝑟=e𝜈 e𝜅, 𝑆, 𝑇𝑜,(2.9) where𝑅𝑎and𝑃𝑟are the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers respectively.𝑆controls the value of the Brunt-V ¨ais¨ala frequency𝑁=√︁ 𝑆𝑇𝑜/ln(𝑟𝑖), which with the polar geometry and profile of𝑔is constant. At the outer boundary, we impose stress-free and𝑇(1)=𝑇 𝑜Dirichlet temperature boundary conditions. In this mixed-layer setup, the interface between the two zones𝑟 𝑖is not an input parameter, contrary to studies where a background adiabatic gradient is imposed. Rather,𝑟 𝑖is controlled by the temperature boundary condition, as we show in Appendix A, as the thermal flux in the CZ and RZ must match in a statistically steady state. Here we take 𝑇𝑜=−0.35, enforcing𝑟 𝑖≈0.5. Similarly, we take𝑃𝑟=0.01, motivated by earlier work suggesting that low𝑃𝑟systems tend to favour reversals (Coustonet al.(2018-a)). These occur when IGW generated by the turbulent core deposit and extract angular momentum in the stably-stratified layer, leading to the development of a mean azimuthal flow in the RZ (Figure 1c). We integrate (2.6-2.8) using the pseudo-spectral code Dedalus (Burnset al.2020), setting two different grids in the radial direction in order to refine the discretisation near the interface between the CZ and RZ (Vasilet al.2016). Concretely, we have a first disk domain with𝑁 𝑟1radial points from𝑟=0 to𝑟=0.6, and a second annular domain with 𝑁𝑟2radial points from𝑟=0.6 to𝑟=1. The azimuthal discretisation is achieved through Fourier series. As the typical oscillation of the stably-stratified layer is large compared to the convective turnover time, this study required long time integrations in order to obtain significant temporal statistics, of the order of several thermal diffusive times𝜏 𝜅=√ 𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟. The temporal evolution is conducted using a 2-step implicit/explicit Runge-Kutta time scheme, using a CFL condition with safety factor of 0.4 (Ascheret al.1997). Typical time steps varied between 10−4and 10−3. Details of the simulations are given in Appendix B. 0X0-5 F. Daniel and D. Lecoanet 3. Theoretical considerations As mentioned in§1, the first studies of wave-induced mean-flow oscillations simplified the problem by considering externally forced waves in a stably-stratified medium. Here we review this approach and apply it to our setup, as we use it to interpret our results (§4). Consider a horizontally-periodic, vertically semi-infinite Cartesian domain, correspond- ing, respectively, to the zonal and radial directions of our polar geometry. At the base of this stably-stratified layer (𝑧=0), two waves of equal amplitudes are generated with same frequenciese𝜔and horizontal wavenumbers e𝑘but opposite phase velocities±e𝑐.

The latter results from both viscous and thermal dissipation, and its expression holds when diffusive timescales based on the vertical wavenumber are large compared to the wave period. The model we present here differs from that of earlier studies as thermal dissipation is usually neglected in the expression of e𝑑. Indeed, as already mentioned in Coustonet al.(2018-a), the wave-mean flow interaction leading to periodic reversals seems to be favoured for low Prandtl fluids, suggesting different typical temporal dissipative dynamics for the waves (e𝜈ande𝜅) and the flow (e𝜈). Some other works also consider linear Rayleigh friction relevant for the atmosphere or laboratory experiments. This introduces another dimensionless parameter 𝛬2=e𝛾e𝑐e𝑑/e𝐿wheree𝛾is the amplitude of the Rayleigh friction. The Reynolds stress (3.2) results from the product of perturbations velocities(𝑢′,𝑤′). These perturbations are taken with respect to the means(⟨𝑢⟩,0). (3.1-3.2) correspond to the Plumb and McEwan model, notably studied by Yoden & Holton (1988); Kim & MacGregor (2001); Renaudet al.(2019). Qualitatively, when there is no Rayleigh friction (𝛬 2=0),⟨𝑢⟩=0 is a solution of (3.1-3.2) that can become unstable when𝛬 1is smaller than a threshold𝛬𝑐 1, i.e. when diffusion is small compared to wave forcing. Introducing Rayleigh friction (𝛬 2>0) tends to stabilise the system and decreases𝛬𝑐 1. This point has been confirmed by linear stability analysis conducted for various boundary conditions (Seminet al.2018; Renaud & Venaille 2020). In the vicinity of the threshold, numerical integration of (3.1-3.2) yields an oscillatory mean flow whose period is of order 1, which means that in dimensional terms, the oscillation period is of ordere𝑐 e𝑑/e𝐿. As mentioned by Semin & P ´etrelis (2024), the fact that the non zero solution past the onset breaks the time translational invariance suggests that the mean velocity undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. They further showed through a weakly nonlinear analysis 0X0-6 Journal of Fluid Mechanics of (3.1-3.2) that depending on the ratio of𝛬 2/𝛬1this bifurcation could either be super or subcritical. In the DNS, as we impose a damping layer at the top of the RZ, most of the dynamics is contained between𝑟 𝑖and𝑟𝑑, which is why we consider𝛬 2=0 and expect a supercritical bifurcation. This low-dimensional model offers an interesting tool for comparing to our DNS. However, there is one main difference between the two approaches.

However, there is one main difference between the two approaches. Convection excites a broad-band, temporally-variable spectrum of waves, opposed to the steady excitation of a single pair of waves assumed here. We will comment on the similarities and differences as we present our results (§4). 4. Results 4.1.CZ and wave properties We will first discuss the convection that develops in our simulations, how it generates waves, and how this impacts the control parameter𝛬 1introduced above. In the core of the domain, we simulate internally-heated thermal convection. Increasing𝑅𝑎from 0 leads the system to bifurcate from the static solution𝒖=0,𝑇=𝑇 𝑠(see Appendix A) to convective patterns and non-zero velocities. As𝑅𝑎is further increased, turbulence sets in (Figure 1b). The typical magnitude of velocity and temperature perturbations can be estimated from simple order of magnitude arguments. Assuming the dominant balance in the radial component of (2.6) for the CZ is between the inertia and buoyancy terms we obtain 𝑢𝜙 𝑟𝜕𝑢𝑟 𝜕𝜙∼𝑟𝑇⇒𝑢 𝜙𝑢𝑟∼𝑇,(4.1) which further assumes that the different contributions in the inertia term are of comparable magnitude. Similarly, assuming the dominant balance in the temperature equation (2.7) is between advection and internal heating, we find for a statistically stationary case ∇·(𝒖𝑇)∼(𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟)−1/2⇒𝑢𝑟𝑇∼(𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟)−1/2.(4.2) Combining (4.1) and (4.2), we obtain 𝑢𝜙𝑢𝑟∼(𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟)−1/3,(4.3) 𝑇∼(𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟)−1/3.(4.4) Note that to derive (4.3-4.4) we dropped order one factors and furthermore assumed the velocity to be typically isotropic𝑢 𝜙∼𝑢𝑟≡𝑢𝑐with (2.8), with order one length scales in both directions. In Figure 2a, we plot⟨𝑢′ 𝜙𝑢′ 𝑟⟩in the CZ(𝑟=0.35), where𝑋′quantities are deviation from their azimuthal mean⟨𝑋⟩. Note that⟨𝑢 𝑟𝑢𝜙⟩=⟨𝑢′ 𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩as⟨𝑢𝑟⟩=0. The plot shows good agreement with (4.3). In addition, there is a dependence on𝑆, consistent with the earlier study of Coustonet al.(2017). They showed that convective plumes are enhanced for low-stiffness simulations, due to the fact that they can penetrate more easily in the radiative layer as𝑁decreases with𝑆(2.5), consistent with our findings. The scaling laws (4.3) and (4.4) are predictions of the so-called ultimate or “Gallet” regime of convection (Kraichnan 1962; Spiegel 1963; Lepotet al.2018). The agreement between our simulations and these scaling laws is indeed not surprising as our convective model is similar to previous ones (Bouillautet al.2019; Hadjerciet al.2024) who demonstrated that for a volumetric heat source, molecular viscosity does not affect the Reynolds number or the heat transfer for flows with high enough𝑅𝑎. The ultimate regime is expected in problems with no thermal boundary layers (Lepotet al.2018). In our polar 0X0-7 F. Daniel and D.

Note that contributions from the mean flows have been removed but keeping them gives the same results. geometry, there is no bottom boundary at𝑟=0, and hence no bottom boundary layer.

Furthermore, the CZ/RZ interface does not act as a thermal boundary layer because there are vertical motions across the interface, and hence the flux is transported by a mix of convection and diffusion. Note that in our case, the thermal flux equilibrium between the two zones (Appendix A) prevents the spatially-averaged temperature to drift in time, which therefore does not require any cooling (Lepotet al.2018). We can rewrite the scaling laws for velocity and temperature into the usual ones for the Reynolds number 𝑅𝑒=e𝑢𝑐e𝑟𝑜/e𝜈∼\u0000𝑅𝑎𝑒𝑓𝑓/𝑃𝑟\u00011/2and Nusselt number𝑁𝑢∼1/𝑇∼\u0000𝑅𝑎𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑃𝑟\u00011/2, introducing an effective Rayleigh number𝑅𝑎 𝑒𝑓𝑓=𝑅𝑎𝑇based on the temperature difference between the centre and the interface. Both scalings are indeed characteristic of the ultimate regime of convection. In other words, the dynamics of the CZ is fundamentally independent of molecular viscosity, which is expected for our setup. In Figure 2b we plot the same quantity⟨𝑢′ 𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩in the stably-stratified region (𝑟=0.7). We find a steeper dependency with𝑅𝑎than in the CZ, with⟨𝑢′ 𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩∼𝑅𝑎−1/2. It is possible to understand the observed behaviour from the theory of Lecoanet & Quataert (2013) (see also Goldreich & Kumar (1990); Coustonet al.(2018-b)). They make a theoretical prediction for the wave energy flux𝐹=𝑢 𝑟𝑝, which is conserved in the absence of dissipation (e.g. Lighthill & Lighthill 1978; Le Sauxet al.2023). Neglecting diffusive effects, they estimate the total wave energy flux to scale as 𝐹∼𝑢𝑐3𝜔𝑐 𝑁,(4.5) with𝑢𝑐∼(𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟)−1/6(4.3) the typical velocity of the CZ and𝜔 𝑐the dominant frequency. We will now show this prediction is consistent with the power-law observed in Figure 2b. To do so, the pressure must be related to the azimuthal velocity, which is done by taking the horizontal derivative of the linearised horizontal component of (2.6) in the bulk of the RZ (no damping layer) and in the inviscid limit. Assuming that the most significant contribution comes from frequency𝜔=𝜔 𝑐and horizontal wavenumbers𝑚=1 leads to 0X0-8 Journal of Fluid Mechanics Figure 3.Wave energy flux temporal spectra measurements for varying𝑅𝑎, fixed𝑆(a-c) and fixed𝑅𝑎, varying 𝑆(d-f). Spectra are computed in the RZ(𝑟=0.7), and displayed for 3 values of horizontal wavenumbers. The dashed lines show comparisons with predictions by Lecoanet & Quataert (2013). 𝑝=𝑟𝜔𝑢𝜙/𝑚, which indeed gives 𝑢𝑟𝑢𝜙∼(𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟)−1/2.(4.6) Thus, similarly to the CZ, the properties of the largest-amplitude waves, which dominate the total wave energy flux and total angular momentum flux, can be explained by diffusion- free arguments. Note this does not necessarily apply to the entire spectrum of IGW, as we discuss next. The dynamics of the waves generated in the CZ and propagating in the RZ can be further characterised by studying spectra. In Figure 3 we show frequency spectra of the wave energy flux for simulations of varying𝑅𝑎(top row) and varying𝑆(bottom row). Reynolds stress or kinetic energy spectra display similar behaviours. Spectra are computed by conducting a double Fourier transform on𝑢 𝑟and𝑝both along the azimuthal and time coordinates, at𝑟=0.7, over one thermal diffusive time.

To eliminate contamination from secular variation, we applied a temporal Hann window function.𝑚=1,2,3 are the first 3 largest horizontal wavenumbers. Focusing on the first row, we observe that the different curves tend to collapse onto one another as the Rayleigh number is increased (as𝐹is not a positive quantity, we only display positive values). This behaviour is consistent with Anderset al.(2023): the shape of the spectra, which is the exciting mechanism for the reversing mean flow, converges for high-enough𝑅𝑎. 0X0-9 F. Daniel and D. Lecoanet Figure 4.Estimate of𝛬 1(3.3) for the same points as in Figure 2, showing how increasing𝑅𝑎tends to favour low𝛬 1values and therefore mean flow reversals when𝛬 1<𝛬𝑐 1=5.10−4(see (4.7) for details). The second row of Figure 3 shows that varying𝑆shifts the spectra to peak at lower frequencies. This can be understood qualitatively by recalling that an increased value of 𝑆corresponds to a higher value of𝑁(§2), and hence to a larger separation between the convective frequency𝜔 𝑐and that of buoyancy𝑁, as the𝑥-axis is normalised by𝑁. Indeed, we observe that the typical width of the spectra for the highest value of𝑆considered (𝑆=19.8, yellow curve) decreases compared to the lower case (𝑆=1.98, green curve), leading to spectra being more peaked. Note that the predictions of Lecoanet & Quataert (2013) assume𝜔 𝑐≪𝑁, whereas here we have𝑁/𝜔 𝑐at most 3.16 (for𝑆=19.8). Indeed, we find their predictions for the frequency spectra (dashed lines) are at best only valid for a small range of frequencies. Lecoanet & Quataert (2013) also assume three-dimensional turbulence, though Lecoanetet al.(2021) find similar spectra in two-dimensional Cartesian simulations. The other important point is that their prediction is derived in the inviscid case. Finally, there are peaks slightly below𝜔=𝑁corresponding to standing modes that have not been completely removed by the damping layer (Lecoanetet al.2021; Anders et al.2023). Using these results we can estimate the value of𝛬 1in our simulations. Rewriting (3.3) using the dimensionless parameters of the DNS gives 𝛬1=1+𝑃𝑟 𝑅𝑎1 ⟨𝑢′𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩\u0012𝑁 𝜔\u00133 𝑘2.(4.7) We have that𝛬 1depends on three simulation outputs, the angular momentum flux⟨𝑢′ 𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩, the frequency ratio𝑁/ 𝜔and the average azimuthal wavenumber 𝑘.𝑋denotes weighted averages (see below).

It enables to obtain a more useful measure of𝛬 1. Using (4.6), we predict that𝛬 1decreases like𝑅𝑎−1/2at fixed𝑆and𝑃𝑟. While we recover this scaling for low𝑅𝑎, at higher𝑅𝑎, we find𝛬∝𝑅𝑎−1/3. As we showed in Figure 2b that⟨𝑢′ 𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩∝𝑅𝑎−1/2,𝛬1∝𝑅𝑎−1/3 means that𝑘or𝜔depend on𝑅𝑎(see Table B). This may be explained by the way we measure𝑘and𝜔. Nevertheless, increasing𝑅𝑎decreases𝛬 1until it becomes smaller than 𝛬𝑐 1. We estimate𝛬𝑐 1≈5.10−4in the simulations (red line of Figure 4). The system is then beyond the onset of a reversing mean flow, i.e. the Rayleigh number is higher than a critical Rayleigh number. Higher values of𝑆, while increasing the corresponding value of critical Rayleigh numbers, does not affect the picture. Note that (4.7) gives some weight to the interpretation of Coustonet al.(2018-a) who observed favoured mean flows for low Prandtl simulations, as𝛬 1∝√ 𝑃𝑟(1+𝑃𝑟). 4.2.Reversing mean flows In Figure 5, we visualise the mean flows generated in simulations with𝑆=1.98 and 𝑅𝑎∈{1010,3.1010,1011}. These correspond to simulations where𝛬 1has become small enough for a mean flow to develop, in agreement with the discussion of§4.1 and Figure 4. In the left column (a-c-e), we plot Hovm ¨oller diagrams showing the zonally averaged azimuthal velocity⟨𝑢 𝜙⟩both as a function of space and time. This is a classical type of representation of the problem (see for instance Wedi & Smolarkiewicz (2006)), which illustrates how the pattern of the flow evolves. Focusing on panel a, we can describe the velocity evolution. At𝑡=0, the mean flow is negative at lower radii in the RZ, and positive at higher radii in the RZ. We will next discuss the propagation and angular momentum transport of first the prograde (positive phase velocity) waves, and then the 0X0-11 F. Daniel and D. Lecoanet Figure 6.Same as in Figure 5 but for𝑅𝑎=1010,𝑆=1.98 (a-b),𝑆=10 (c-d) and𝑆=19.8 (e-f). retrograde (negative phase velocity) waves. Prograde IGW propagate from the CZ/RZ interface towards the top of the layer. They are absorbed by the medium at a relatively high radius where their absorption leads to a local acceleration of the flow. As time goes by (until𝑡≈0.5𝜏 𝜅), the absorption process occurs lower as the waves are preferentially absorbed when⟨𝑢 𝜙⟩∼𝑐(see for instance (3.2)). This leads to the mean flow to propagate downward and even penetrate into the CZ. While these prograde waves are subsequently absorbed at lower radii, retrograde waves are not filtered by the positive mean flow and are able to propagate in the RZ to deposit their angular momentum, with a blue patch that starts to appear at high radii at𝑡≈0.2𝜏 𝜅. It is the alternation between the absorption processes of prograde and retrograde waves that gives birth to the observed large scale oscillation which repeats afterwards. It is in good agreement with reduced models, the main difference here is that the spectrum of waves is continuous (Figure 3). Note",

It is in good agreement with reduced models, the main difference here is that the spectrum of waves is continuous (Figure 3). Note that the typical period of mean flow reversals is comparable to the thermal diffusion time, i.e., much longer than the convective turnover time (see the rapid variations in the CZ). Similar results were obtained by Coustonet al.(2018-a) in Cartesian geometry. This phenomenon is also observed on panels c and e, but the pattern described before is different. Indeed, for the highest𝑅𝑎reported (panel e), the mean flow has a modified shape, which we interpret as the transition towards a quasi-periodic behaviour. Shorter reversals of the flows can be seen close to the CZ/RZ interface. This is expected in the Plumb-McEwan model (Kim & MacGregor 2001; Renaudet al.2019) when𝛬 1is sufficiently reduced, but here we report a clear example with a self-consistent wave spectrum. In the right column of Figure 5 (panels b-d-f), we plot phase portraits of two local probes of the flow at𝑟=0.7 and𝑟=0.8. Phase portraits show the emergence of limit cycles and their regularity (Kim & MacGregor 2001). Combining these two representations illustrates how increasing𝑅𝑎affects the evolution of the flow: the shape shown in panel b displays a regular limit cycle, in agreement with the Hovm ¨oller diagram shown in panel a. There is a single orbit as the flow is periodic. Note the short time scale fluctuations clearly visible in this representation, attributable to fluctuations due to the CZ. The orbit is however modified in panel d and f as𝑅𝑎is increased, with limit cycles exhibiting now a more complex shape. 0X0-12 Journal of Fluid Mechanics Figure 7.Dominant period evolution.a)Measurement in our data set via Fourier transform (see text for details) as a function of𝑅𝑎for several𝑆.b)Same as a) but as a function of𝑋 𝑇(4.8). Simulations for which𝛬 1is higher than𝛬𝑐 1are reported as empty symbols. In panel f, the phase portrait is expected to fill in a torus as the flow is quasi-periodic. Thus, increasing𝑅𝑎maintains reversals while modifying the period of the flow. In Figure 6, we visualise the mean flows generated in simulations with𝑅𝑎=1010 and𝑆∈{1.98,10,19.8}. While, as shown above, we find regular mean-flow oscillations for low𝑆(panels𝑎and𝑏), increasing𝑆causes the mean flow evolution to become increasingly irregular (panels𝑐-𝑓). That said, the mean flow still exhibits downward- propagating patterns for higher values of𝑆. Note that in Figure 5 we plot the mean flow evolution for 2 thermal times, whereas in Figure 6 we plot the mean flow evolution for 1.5 thermal times. This is in part due to computational constraints, as higher𝑆simulations require higher vertical resolution. Next we turn our attention to the period of the mean-flow oscillations. We measure the period𝑇 𝑜𝑠𝑐by finding the frequency of the highest-amplitude peak of the Fourier transform of𝑢 𝜙(𝑟=0.65). We find that𝑇 𝑜𝑠𝑐is insensitive to the choice of radius.

We find that𝑇 𝑜𝑠𝑐is insensitive to the choice of radius. We plot𝑇𝑜𝑠𝑐for each of our simulations in Figure 7a. Simulations without coherent mean- flow oscillations (𝛬 1> 𝛬𝑐 1) correspond to cases where a regular mean flow is difficult to observe, but nevertheless exhibit some activities in their RZ. We also plot with a dashed line𝑇 𝑜𝑠𝑐∝𝜏𝜅=√ 𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟, following the observations of Figure 5 where the two time scales appear to be connected.

The combination of the dependencies of both⟨𝑢′ 𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩and𝜏𝜅on𝑅𝑎and𝑃𝑟 leads𝑇𝑜𝑠𝑐∝(𝑅𝑎𝑃𝑟)1. The diffusive time scale constrains the oscillation of the mean flow through the typical damping length of the waves, which for low𝑃𝑟fluids is dominated by thermal diffusion.

The Plumb-McEwan model also makes predictions for the velocity amplitude of the mean flow. Figure 8a shows the rms zonal velocity⟨𝑢 𝜙⟩in the RZ as a function of𝑅𝑎for several𝑆. On the one hand, for𝑆=1.98, the flow increases in amplitude until𝑅𝑎=1010. We can interpret this in terms of the 1D model for which the control parameter is 1/𝛬 1. Thus, for this Hopf bifurcation, we expect the velocity to increase as the square root of the supercriticality, i.e.𝑢𝑅𝑍 𝑟𝑚𝑠/𝑐∝√︁(𝛬𝑐 1−𝛬 1)/𝛬 1≡√𝜀. We show in panel b that this is consistent with the three lowest𝑅𝑎at𝑆=1.98, though this result is very sensitive to the precise value of𝛬𝑐 1. However, for larger𝑅𝑎 >1010we find smaller amplitude mean flows, which we attribute to the emergence of new patterns and the transition towards a quasi-periodic state. On the other hand, increasing𝑆seems to reduce the amplitude of the flow through a higher value of the Brunt-V ¨ais¨al¨a frequency. We want to emphasise one the striking finding of our paper that, DNS, although involving a continuous spectrum of IGW due to the CZ, are well captured by the Plumb and McEwan model. It hints that spectra, through their dominant frequency, act as an effective monochromatic forcing. This point should however be nuanced and remains qualitative, particularly for the velocity. The ability of the reduced model to quantitatively compare to global simulations outputs was tested by Coustonet al.(2018-a) who extracted DNS spectra of various frequencies and horizontal wavenumbers. Concretely, it consists in integrating numerically the model of§3 while summing contributions of the Reynolds stress (3.2) from several waves, taking for the prefactors the values measured in DNS.

Concretely, it consists in integrating numerically the model of§3 while summing contributions of the Reynolds stress (3.2) from several waves, taking for the prefactors the values measured in DNS. While they were able to reproduce mean flow reversals with this mixed DNS-Plumb and McEwan model, the comparison was not perfect. One possible reasons could be that, as in our case, the important level of fluctuations due to the CZ limits the comparison with the 1D model. Indeed (see§3), the latter considers deterministic dynamics, i.e. neglects any stochastic processes. We posit that the fluctuations of the CZ, for instance acting through temporal variations of⟨𝑢′ 𝑟𝑢′ 𝜙⟩, affects the classical picture. Their effect could be thought of as a 0X0-14 Journal of Fluid Mechanics Figure 9.Temporal behaviours of the mean flow.a)Local probes of the zonally averaged velocity at𝑟=0.65 as a function of time for𝑅𝑎=1010and𝑅𝑎=1011both at𝑆=1.98.b)Corresponding Fourier transform for the signals reported in a). The x-axis is normalised by the value of the dominant frequency in each case. multiplicative noise, which we discuss in§5. The present point is that in the perspective of understanding the system as resulting from a Hopf bifurcation, the notion of a threshold only makes sense statistically. This may explain why the run at𝑆=10,𝑅𝑎=1010has 𝛬1> 𝛬𝑐 1(see Appendix B), i.e. should be classified as stable, but nevertheless exhibits features (see again Figure 6c) that are typical of a reversing mean flow. Fluctuations are also apparent in the phase portraits of Figures 5 and 6 where noise superimposed to limit cycles is clearly visible. We show in Figure 9⟨𝑢 𝜙⟩(𝑟=0.65)for the simulations𝑆=1.98,𝑅𝑎=1010and 𝑅𝑎=1011, corresponding to the Hovm ¨oller diagrams reported in Figure 5a and e. We use these data to measure the mean-flow oscillation periods. We show the corresponding Fourier transform in Figure 9b. The time series illustrate the time scale separation which is at the basis of past reduced models. Convective motions produce variations on timescales 𝑂(1). It is these rapid variations that lead to the much longer oscillation of𝑂(104) corresponding to the reversing mean flow. On the right, the Fourier transforms exhibit two clear peaks. Interestingly, even the peak-to-peak amplitude fluctuates, as the results of the CZ noise discussed earlier. We also see that the typical mean-flow velocity decreases as Ra increases (Figure 8b). Our interpretation is that the system undergoes a second transition in this case, leading to the emergence of a second noticeable peak in the Fourier transform. Indeed, a higher frequency emerges on the red curve of Figure 8b, which seems to be situated between 3 and 4𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥. The fact that it does not correspond to an integer multiple of𝑓𝑚𝑎𝑥suggests the transition to a quasi-periodic regime, as one would rather expect clear harmonics—integer multiples of𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥—if the system were to remain periodic. This is compatible with the temporal probe of panel a, which exhibits shorter oscillations between each global extremum, that are absent for𝑅𝑎=1010, as well as with the panel e of Figure 5, where shorter oscillations appear",

This is compatible with the temporal probe of panel a, which exhibits shorter oscillations between each global extremum, that are absent for𝑅𝑎=1010, as well as with the panel e of Figure 5, where shorter oscillations appear at𝑟=0.65. We also report a third peak lower than𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥 for the𝑅𝑎=1011simulation at𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑥/2, compatible with a period-doubling scenario. This was already observed in reduced models for some range of the parameters (Kim & MacGregor 2001), and is a classical scenario 0X0-15 F. Daniel and D. Lecoanet transition towards chaotic states. Note however that caution must be considered about this point as very long statistics—numerically demanding—could improve the quality of the signals. It is besides not impossible that fluctuations could lead this 1/2 peak to be only a transient, or that other quasi-periodic states could emerge, corresponding to different ratios of frequencies (Kim & MacGregor 2001; Renaudet al.2019). While increasing𝑅𝑎from 1010to 1011modifies the picture with the onset of different patterns, both visually (Figure 5) and in the spectra (Figure 9b), it is not clear yet why the velocity decreases in this case. Further investigation of the emergence of peculiar frequencies could be an interesting perspective in future laboratory experiments which can produce longer datasets than DNS. 5. Discussion and perspectives In this paper, we studied the dynamics of mean flow oscillation in a stably stratified layer, through the coupling with a convectively unstable layer. Extending earlier work by Couston et al.(2018-a) in Cartesian geometry, we worked in polar geometry, and via a parametric survey, investigated the role of varying the strength of convection (𝑅𝑎) and the buoyancy frequency (𝑆) on the mean flow oscillations. Our results showed overall good agreement with the weakly nonlinear analysis of a reduced model of the problem conducted by Seminet al.(2018). The mean flow develops as a Hopf bifurcation, leading to a simple dependence of its period and velocity amplitude in the vicinity of the threshold (Figures 7 and 8). Further from the bifurcation threshold, the system develops more interesting nonlinear behaviours (Figure 9). As this rich topic is at the boundary between Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics and nonlinear physics, we now discuss some directions about possible future works. A broader exploration of the parameter regime of this problem could be conducted. Even if going towards astrophysical values for𝑅𝑎and𝑆is out of reach—broadly expected to be larger than 1020and 106—it would be interesting to run simulations at𝑆=𝑂(100)in the context of mean flows, as the CZ was observed to be barely affected by the RZ in this regime (Coustonet al.2017). Those simulations would nevertheless be very demanding numerically with high spatial resolutions for very long temporal integrations. Besides the control parameters that we varied here (𝑅𝑎and𝑆) or that were varied in the past (𝑃𝑟by Coustonet al.(2018-a)), it is worth commenting the additional ones used in our model. The internal heating profile has a spatial extension controlled by𝑟 𝑏=0.1 that was not changed. As discussed in§2,𝑟 𝑏value has been chosen so that𝑟 𝑏< 𝑟𝑖 to confine heating to the",
    "were varied in the past (𝑃𝑟by Coustonet al.(2018-a)), it is worth commenting the additional ones used in our model. The internal heating profile has a spatial extension controlled by𝑟 𝑏=0.1 that was not changed. As discussed in§2,𝑟 𝑏value has been chosen so that𝑟 𝑏< 𝑟𝑖 to confine heating to the CZ, but varying its value could change things quantitatively. Nevertheless, the fact that mixed layers models can lead to a reversing mean flow with two types of convection—internal heating here or classical Rayleigh B ´enard boundary forcing (Coustonet al.2018-a)—suggests that the global picture does not depend on these precise details of the CZ. Another important assumption of our model is the form of the damping layer. Even if it depends on two parameters (𝑟 𝑑and𝛿), the fact that it is confined to the very top of the domain makes it compatible with the classical picture of the QBO. Indeed, the wave absorption mechanism described in the discussion of Figure 5 (see also Vallis (2017)) implies that there is no downwards propagation of the waves, i.e. that the mean flow is not affected by what occurs above the highest level of wave absorption. This description is relevant for the atmosphere where the waves are expected to break if they reach high- enough altitudes. However, in stars, this is not necessarily the case as reflections can occur. Indeed, standing modes are observed via asteroseismology (see for instance Aerts (2021)). Standing modes are still present in our simulations due to the reflection with the top boundary (see Figure 3). A further investigation of this problem could be to compare 0X0-16 Journal of Fluid Mechanics simulations relevant for planets, with a damping layer, to simulations relevant for stars, with a reflecting boundary. This could be for instance done in the light of recent results by Chartrandet al.(2024) who studied the effect of the ratio of the wave damping length to the size of the domain, which would amount to varying𝑑/(𝑟 𝑑−𝑟𝑖)in our case. Another interesting possibility could be to examine other techniques to more effectively prevent reflections (e.g. Berenger (1994)). Different dissipation mechanisms have been studied in different models. The Plumb- McEwan model considers a mix between diffusion and friction which as described above (§3) can be non-dimensionalised using𝛬 1and𝛬 2respectively. For most of the RZ between 𝑟𝑖and𝑟𝑑, our model does not have friction. Thus, in the notation of Seminet al.(2018), we have𝛬 2=0. This means the effect of changing𝑁is different in the two systems. For us, varying𝑆, and hence𝑁, only modifies𝛬 1as𝛬 2=0. Thus, we always find supercritical bifurcations. In contrast, when Seminet al.(2018) vary𝑁in their laboratory experiments, this changes both𝛬 1and𝛬 2, and allows for the transition from supercritical to subcritical bifurcations that are not observed in our system. The qualitative agreement we managed to highlight through the present work between the study of Seminet al.(2018) and ours raises the more general question of how to compare complex global simulations involving a large number of modes to simpler reduced models considering only a few.

    "to highlight through the present work between the study of Seminet al.(2018) and ours raises the more general question of how to compare complex global simulations involving a large number of modes to simpler reduced models considering only a few. As DNS are very demanding numerically, reduced models offer a complimentary approach. If the Plumb and McEwan approach has already proven to capture the dynamics of the QBO despite its apparent simplicity (Baldwinet al.2001; Renaudet al. 2019), we believe that our model could serve as a starting point for improvement as the CZ is self-consistently simulated. Related to the fluctuant dynamics of the latter and the discussion around Figure 9, future works should focus on characterising the effect of the noise on the generation of the mean flow. This could be done via a twofold approach. First by modifying the model of§3 in order to study the effect of a multiplicative noise (e.g. Fauveet al.(2017)) on the mechanism, as was for instance done by Ewetola & Esler (2024). Note that stochastic dynamics were also considered in Renaud (2018) but through additive noise, showing interesting complex behaviours. Second, DNS could be used to infer the precise properties of the noise induced by the CZ, in the spirit of laboratory experiments focusing on fluctuations (Auma ˆıtre & Fauve 2003) or DNS (Labarreet al.2023), through probability density functions. Similar characteristics were already measured in Couston et al.(2018-a) that could be used to set the noise of a stochastic Plumb McEwan model. To conclude this study, we finally discuss the initial motivation for this work (§1) which is stellar fluid dynamics and astrophysical applications. Indeed, the geometry of the domain was chosen to model a massive star with a convective core and a radiative envelope. Many simplifications were assumed that could be investigated in the future by adding physical effects to the current model, for instance 3D dynamics, rotation, or even magnetic fields. In this work, we employ the Boussinesq approximation and a piecewise-linear equation of state to model the interaction between a CZ and a RZ. Thus, we assume that density variations are small between the core and the surface. While this is not the case for stars (see for instance Anderset al.(2023)), our approach allows to tackle the coupling between the two zones self-consistently. In a star, the fluid transitions from convective to stably- stratified due to large changes in the background thermodynamic profiles. Going towards fully-compressible, or in an intermediate step anelastic simulations, may therefore appear as an appealing next step for astrophysical considerations. While it is not possible to run simulations at realistic parameter values, it is possible to extrapolate our results to astrophysical parameters. Using the characteristics of a 15 solar mass star (Lecoanet & Edelmann 2023; Anderset al.2023), a direct numerical application of (4.7) leads to𝛬 1≈2.10−6≪𝛬𝑐 1. Oscillations of the kind reported here are then 0X0-17 F. Daniel and D. Lecoanet expected, with a typical period of order 5.106years (4.8). Note that this estimate is an upper limit of the period and could differ in a real star. For",

Lecoanet expected, with a typical period of order 5.106years (4.8). Note that this estimate is an upper limit of the period and could differ in a real star. For instance, we have discussed that the behaviour of𝛬 1changes with𝑅𝑎(Figure 4). In our simulations, waves interact with the mean flow diffusively, whereas in atmospherical and astrophysical applications they are thought to interact with the mean flow via critical layer interactions and wave breaking. Indeed, the fact that𝑢𝑅𝑍 𝑟𝑚𝑠/𝑐≪1 (Figure 8) combined with the discussion about the oscillation being related to the wave damping length—through the thermal diffusive time (4.8)—highlights that waves are absorbed via diffusive processes and not wave breaking. This question will be addressed in a future work by focusing solely on the RZ, where an emphasis will be put on how wave breaking affects the mean flow. It could be interesting to connect breaking and the reduced model approach, through the use of turbulent diffusion coefficients. These could drastically reduce the previous estimate of the period. In the tradition of the history of wave-induced mean flows, adopting various approaches with different scales, through 1D or global DNS, seems the adequate philosophy to tackle this rich nonlinear problem.
