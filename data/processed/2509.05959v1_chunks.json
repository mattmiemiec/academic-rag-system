    "The Case for a DNANF 1Pb/s Trans -Atlantic Submarine Cable Pierluigi Poggiolini(1), Francesco Poletti(2) (1) DET, Politecnico di Torino, C.so Duca Abruzzi 24, 10129, Torino, Italy, pierluigi.poggiolini@polito.it (2) ORC , Univ . of Southampton, UK, and Microsoft Azure Fiber, The Quadrangle, Romsey UK, frap@orc.soton.ac.uk Abstract The recent progress in low -loss hollow -core fibers allows to speculate on the possibility of building a transatlantic submarine cable that can achieve the goal of 1 Pb/s per direction, leveraging bidirectional transmission, and at the same time drastically increas e span length, theoretically to 2 00km. ©202 5 The Author(s) Introduction Recent results on hollow -core fibers of the DNANF type have shown loss below 0.11 dB/km [1][2], with hints that some DNANF segments had much lower loss in the C -band , on the order of 0.05- 0.08 dB/km. This is compatible with theory, that shows that loss values as low as 0.05 dB/km should be indeed possible [12]. At the same time, bidirectional transmission has also been recently demonstrated, leveraging the ultra- low backscat- tering of DNANFs [3]. In addition, the possibility of ultra- long system spans with DNANF, reaching up to 150- 250km thanks to the combination of their low-loss and ultra- low non-linearity , was pointed out in [ 4]. All these circumstances , specific to DNANF , make it possible to hypothesize building a trans-atlantic (TAT) cable whose total throughput reaches the 1 Pb/s threshold, while allowing to stretch the span length to unprecedented values , on the order of 200km. This latter aspect would allow important savings and would also greatly ease the power supply hurdle which is one of the key factors preventing submarine cables from scaling up throughput. This paper analyses this scenario, making the case that the potential for DNANFs to allow TAT cables to be realized with such features is theo- retically there , and that it is worth further and deeper investigation, as well as experimental ex- ploration. The 1 Pb/s DNANF system configuration The cable is assumed to be a standard- diameter submarine cable , containing 26 DNANF s in total. This number of fibers is a conjecture based on the following reasoning. New cables (such as A n- jana [5] or Medusa [6]) carry 24 solid-core fiber (SCF) pairs , i.e., 48 SCFs. Such SCFs are re- duced- diameter ones (conceivably 200μm). DNANFs necessarily have larger diameter so fewer would fit a similarly built cable. However, through simple math, the same cable cross- sec- tion fitting 48 200 μm SCFs would presumably fit 26 DNANFs with diameter 27 0 μm, a value that we assume to be sufficient to support DNANF . We then assume that traffic is carried in the C -band only, over a bandwidth of 5THz. The DNANF s are used bi -directionally so 26 full C - band combs propagate in each direction. We consider state -of-the-art transceivers with proba- bilistic constellation shaping (PCS). We adopt for such TXRs the (non-model -specific ) net-infor- mation- rate vs. GSNR curve shown in Fig.1.

We adopt for such TXRs the (non-model -specific ) net-infor- mation- rate vs. GSNR curve shown in Fig.1. We assume that the channel symbol rate is 73.5 GBaud and the channel spacing is 75 GHz, as for the ultra- long- haul PSC experiment n.2 in [7]. The DNANF is assumed to have dispersion 3ps/(nm km) and non- linearity coefficient 5 ⋅10 −4 1/(W km). An inter-modal -interference (IMI) of -65 dB/km is considered . At each repeater a DNANF -to-SCF transition is needed. These components have been re- ported with loss lower than 0.2dB [13]. We as- sume here a conservative value of 0.7dB. We also assume negligible back -reflection. Next, a circulator is needed to extract the incoming signal and insert the outgoing one for the counter -prop- agating direction . C-band circulators are com- mercially available with loss <1dB. We assume 1dB. We then add another 0. 3dB loss margin so that loss before the EDFA input is 2dB . The EDFA noise figure is set to 4.6 dB [7]. At the out- put of the EDFA the signal encounters another circulator and a SCF-to-DNANF transition. We assume the same conservative loss as at the EDFA input (2dB), including a 0.3dB margin. Finally , we set the span length to the challeng- ing value of 200km. The total cable length is Fig. 1: Transceiver net information rate vs. GSNR. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 GSNR (dB)2468101214net IR (bits/symbol)Shannon assumed to be 6600km, similar to the MAREA TAT cable [8]. Performance results The analysis method is the same as described in [9],[4]. The resulting GNSR accounts for ASE noise, IMI and NLI noise, the latter through the GN-model. TRX noise is embedded in the curve Fig.1, which is used to obtain the net throughput from GSNR. The droop effect [10] is neglected since the operating GSNRs (see later) are large . In Fig.2 a and Fig.2b the contour plots of the GSNR and of the net overall cable throughput are shown, respectively . The abscissa is DNANF loss and the ordinate is the total output power per EDFA. Note that the power entering each DNANF is 2dB lower than shown in Fig.2, due to the cir- culator and SCF -DNANF transition present at the EDFA output and whose combined loss, as men-tioned, was assumed to be 2dB. Fig.2b shows that 1Pb/s, currently considered as a landmark achievement for possible future cables, is ideally reachable at 0.07dB/km DNANF loss, with a C -band EDFA output power of 22.5 dBm. It is also reachable at about 0.06 and 0.05 dB/km loss, at EDFA output power s of 20.3 and 18 dBm, respectively . It should also be noted that a still remarkable 0.9 Pb/s is possible, at the men- tioned DNANF loss values, with a reduction of 2dB EDFA power. All these operating points have a GSNR greater than 14 dB (see Fig. 2a), which",
    "s of 20.3 and 18 dBm, respectively . It should also be noted that a still remarkable 0.9 Pb/s is possible, at the men- tioned DNANF loss values, with a reduction of 2dB EDFA power. All these operating points have a GSNR greater than 14 dB (see Fig. 2a), which ensures that the droop effect is negligible [10]. In the following, we consider as “reference” the operating point: 0.06dB/km loss, 20.3 dBm per EDFA , 1Pb/s . While very challenging, a loss of 0.06dB/km over the C -band is compatible with theoretical predictions and some of the experi- mental results [1],[2]. Also, while the EDFA output power of 20.3 dBm is somewhat large for a sub- marine system, it would be compatible with the cable power supply limit currently considered to be about 18kW [7]. The reason is that the number of submerged repeaters is only 32, as opposed to 80-100 for SCF transatlantic cables [7]. Power dissipation could be estimated at 6.6kW from the cable (assuming 1A current and 1 Ω/km cable resistance) and 5.76kW from repeaters. The lat- ter number assumes 180W per repeater , a figure compatible with the dat a shown in [11]. The total DNANF system power consumption would then be less than 13kW, well below the 18kW limit. In fact, the DNANF TAT cable at the “refer- ence” operating point is not power -limited , but space- limited . It appears that 18kW would be enough to support substantially more than the as- sumed 26 DNANFs (about 40-50). This suggests that a technology research path towards bigger cables , capable of carrying more DNANFs, could potential ly get close to 2Pb/s per TAT cable within today’s power supply limits . Finally, we explored different span lengths than 200km. The required output power per EDFA to achieve 1 Pb/s net throughput is shown in Fig.3. The plot shows that at 0.06dB/km loss, reducing the span length to 170km may reduce the needed EDFA output power by about 1dB. Conversely, 220- 230km span length would be at- tainable if it was 1dB higher. Similar curves for 0.05 and 0.07dB/km loss are also shown Discussion and competing technologies A 1Pb/s throughput DNANF TAT cable would be about double the throughput of the very recent SCF Anjana cable, which completed deployment in Oct. 2024. But one of the most remarkable fea- tures of the DNANF cable would be its small num- ber of repeaters (32). Many recent studies have focused on re- duced- diameter and multi -core fibers. However, the key insurmountable difference between any system based on DNANF vs. systems based on any type of single or multicore SCF is indeed the span length. The typical 60 to 70km length span length in SCF transatlantic systems cannot be ex- ceeded because of the fundamental loss and Fig. 2: 6600km link with 200km spans, 26 DNANF .

The possibility for DNANF cables to aim at 3x the span length, and perhaps 4x if loss reaches down to 0.05dB/km, sets them completely apart from any SCFs sys- tem. Besides such prominent advantages , the use of DNANFs would bring about further wel- come consequences . One is the drastic mitiga- tion of EEPN, since DNANF dispersion is about 1/8 that of PSCF . For the same reason, DSP complexity would shrink substantially : while not a deciding factor, it is certainly a welcome plus. Finally, another key aspect is latency. Trans- atlantic propagation takes 33ms in SCF and 22ms in DNANF. While for most users the differ- ence may not be meaningful, for some users this difference is very valuable. In this respect too, of course, there is no possibility for SCF to compete. Though this paper focuses on transatlantic links, the advantages described above broadly apply to transpacific cables as well , which we do not address here for lack of space. Challenges Several challenges stand in the way of realizing the DNANF cable system s described above. One is mass production. Educated guesses may place total DNANF production in 2024 at a few thousands km. A single TAT cable carrying 26 DNANFs would require about 170,000km. The gap between these figure s is evident. Also, the remarkable low -loss results [ 1],[2] were shown over short stretches: achieving 0.06- 0.07 dB/km loss consistently over multi -thousand km produc- tion fiber is a much more challenging feat. Another aspect that needs attention is the ability for DNANF to reliably achiev e low values of IMI. We assumed - 65dB/km . A value of −60 dB/km would still be not too critical as it would lead to requiring 21. 2dB EDFA output power to achieve 1 Pb/s at 0.06 dB/km loss , up 0.9 dB with respect to Fig.2b. However, above −60dB/km performance degrades steeply so it is indispen- sable that IMI be kept under control. On the other hand, very recent results hint at some DNANF achieving -70dB/km, which is reassuring [14]. Though remarkable experiments have con- firmed the bi -directional capability of DNANF [3], still the reliability of enabling components such as circulators needs to be confirmed for submarine use. But p erhaps the most critical component in the chain is the DNANF -to-SCF transition. This component needs to have loss below 1dB and negligible back -reflection. Very e ncouraging re- sults have appeared in the literature [13], but fur- ther development and ruggedization is needed. Also, we have assumed",
    "But p erhaps the most critical component in the chain is the DNANF -to-SCF transition. This component needs to have loss below 1dB and negligible back -reflection. Very e ncouraging re- sults have appeared in the literature [13], but fur- ther development and ruggedization is needed. Also, we have assumed in our calculations that DNANF can be mass -produced with cutting - edge performance at an outer diameter of only 270 μm. This is a bold assumption , since the air - filled cavity of DNANF has a very wide diameter of approximately 90 μm. On the other hand, this requirement might relax in the future, since it is ideally possible that bigger cables capable of hosting 26 or even more DNANFs at, say , 280- 300μm diameter will be manufactured, once the advantage of using DNANF in the transoceanic realm is definitively proven. Another known problem is the presence of gas contaminants in the hollow core, namely wa-ter and carbon dioxide, the latter causing thin ab- sorption lines to show up in C and L band. Con- taminants must be eliminated and perhaps trans-mission techniques tolerati ng some residual level should be developed. Finally, an overarching challenge is obviously cost. DNANF cost must come down to the level needed to make DNANF transoceanic cables economically competitive . This aspect is well be- yond the scope of this paper and has to do with production technology development as well as techno- economics at various levels , but it is of course the bottom- line enabler for DNANF TAT cables to become a reality . Conclusion The recent progress in low -loss hollow -core fi- bers allowed us to speculate on the possibility of building a transatlantic submarine cable that can achieve the iconic goal of 1 Pb/s per direction and, at the same time, drastically increase span length, to a previously unthinkable 200km. Based on recent results, both theoretical and experi- mental, and reasonable hypothes es, these sys- tems appear to be in the realm of potentially pos- sible achievements. A number of challenges stand in the way, some technological, some economical, of which we tried to provide a partial list. This said, the unique features of DNANF make the case of a DNANF submarine cable extremely compelling and, in our opinion, worth intense investigation .
